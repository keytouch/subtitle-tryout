1
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,360
1873 in the Drôme

2
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,720
Here, Joseph.

3
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,200
For your collection.

4
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,880
You can keep it.
The name is illegible.

5
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,440
Joseph, I know that
the world of people scares you.

6
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,840
But you must come.

7
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,560
Come on now.

8
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,360
For Rosalie. For your son.

9
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,560
We are gathered here, this afternoon,
to bid farewell to Rosalie Cheval,

10
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,760
née Rosalie Revol,

11
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,240
wife of Joseph Ferdinand Cheval,
postal employee,

12
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,680
and mother of Cyrille Cheval.

13
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,920
Victoire and I are too old
to look after our grandson.

14
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,400
He will go to Lyon,
to live with his aunt and uncle.

15
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,560
How will you do your rounds?

16
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,760
What will you do with the lad?

17
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,400
End of story.

18
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,080
Cyrille, go say goodbye
to your father.

19
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
Hurry up.

20
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,360
Say goodbye.

21
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,320
Goodbye, Dad.

22
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,880
- Auguste.
- Yes?

23
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
Can you take it for me?

24
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,440
Of course. But why do you
always bring me your post?

25
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,160
Cheval passes your house every day.

26
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,480
You saw it yourself.
He didn't even shed a tear for Rosalie.

27
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,040
- He's an animal.
- He just doesn't have any tears left.

28
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,360
Well, he scares me.

29
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,840
Listen, Félicienne,
that's just the way he is...

30
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,040
withdrawn.

31
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,600
Extraordinary discovery

32
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,480
in the Cambodian jungle:

33
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,880
the temples

34
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,840
of Angkor.

35
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,680
Angkor.

36
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,200
Angkor...

37
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,880
Hello.

38
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,880
Which way to Rufus Comblet's house?

39
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,360
Behind the house, follow the path,
turn right at the crossing.

40
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,520
Are you new?

41
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,440
I've never seen you before.

42
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,560
Philomène Richaud.

43
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,520
Postman Cheval.

44
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,880
They've extended my rounds.

45
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,040
Wait.

46
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,240
It's a steep path to the Comblet's.

47
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
More?

48
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,800
What do you think about as you walk?

49
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,640
It must take a long time.

50
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,920
Well, thank you.

51
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,920
I'll be off.

52
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,480
See you tomorrow,
Postman Cheval.

53
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,320
Right at the crossing!

54
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,720
Did you see widow Richaud?

55
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,280
- Yes.
- How is she doing up there?

56
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,240
I don't know.
She's alone.

57
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
I dream.

58
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,600
Pardon?

59
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,320
The other day, you asked me
what I do when I walk.

60
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,640
Well, I dream.

61
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,640
- And you don't get bored?
- No.

62
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,920
I'm happy when I walk.

63
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,120
Earlier, I was imagining
building a house in the forest,

64
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,000
with branches,
leaves and flowers.

65
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,520
It must be a pretty house.

66
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,720
Have you heard
of the Mayan temples?

67
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,160
No.

68
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,840
There are some
in Picturesque magazine.

69
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,360
Are you hurt?

70
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,440
- No, it's nothing.
- No, it's not nothing, it's...

71
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,080
It's infected.

72
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,800
It's... empty.

73
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,160
What more does it need?

74
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,440
A little sweep, perhaps.

75
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,760
The bed by the window...

76
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,000
I like it.

77
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,720
I have some pale red fabric left.
It will look nice here.

78
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,080
It's so beautiful.

79
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,760
Where did you learn to do that?

80
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,440
I was an apprentice baker
in Romans, in Valence.

81
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,680
The important thing is your palm.

82
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,440
You must forget your fingers.

83
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,600
- Can I taste it?
- No, that's not allowed.

84
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,320
It's better like that.

85
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,000
Taste it.

86
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,040
Go on, taste it.

87
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,440
I have some handsome eggplants.

88
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,320
And some zucchini over there.

89
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,640
- I even have some sage.
- How lucky!

90
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,400
You'll have food this winter.

91
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,280
- They say it'll be harsh.
- I heard.

92
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,360
Thank you.

93
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,560
- What does your Joseph think of it?
- He hasn't said anything yet.

94
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,320
- He was never a big talker, your man.
- He's certainly not a chatterbox.

95
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,120
Leave the big talkers
to the village vipers.

96
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,200
I know what people say
about my Joseph.

97
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,360
They say I'm married to a simpleton.

98
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,960
But I know he's different.
He's a good person.

99
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,680
He may not talk, my Joseph,
but he acts.

100
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,480
- Already?
- Yes. Can you believe it?

101
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,880
- I'm sorry, forgive me.
- No. Don't apologize.

102
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,240
As long as I have my fabrics
and my dresses to make...

103
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,440
And I'm really happy for you.

104
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,720
- Does Joseph know?
- Not yet.

105
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,800
- He'll be happy.
- Yes, I think so.

106
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,560
What are you doing here?

107
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,800
- Goodbye, Auguste.
- Goodbye, Félicienne.

108
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,600
Come on dog.

109
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,840
What are you fretting about?

110
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,320
Philomène is with child.

111
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,600
Congratulations.

112
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,280
Don't.

113
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,120
But Joseph, you should be happy.

114
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,760
You'll even get a bonus
from the post office.

115
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,800
It's not that.

116
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,440
I don't know what to do
with children.

117
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,120
Philomène will resent that.

118
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,840
No, she won't, don't worry.

119
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,760
Anyway, it's not a man's job
to look after the children.

120
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,360
Go on, go home.

121
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,920
I'll take breaks. Longer breaks.
That's what I'll do, take breaks.

122
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,360
I'll take breaks.

123
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,000
Cheval!

124
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,600
It's a girl.

125
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,280
Don't you want me
to make you something else?

126
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,120
Turnips? Carrots?

127
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,320
- You eat the same thing every day.
- It's good for the heart.

128
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,120
You'll get ill.

129
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,920
Are you hungry?

130
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
Yes.

131
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,000
Yes. Give me a smile.

132
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,440
Give me a smile.

133
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,360
Go on, a smile.

134
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,760
My princess.

135
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,240
Come here.
We're nice and comfy.

136
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,280
Philomène!

137
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,320
I've just finished the dress.
Come up.

138
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,800
If you'd try it on,
it'll help me with the trimmings.

139
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,560
I'll be back.

140
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,400
What are you doing?

141
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,040
She...

142
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,000
She was crying.

143
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,640
She's pretty, isn't she?

144
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,560
Why did you bring this rock home?
It almost killed you.

145
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,120
I'm warning you, this will sting.

146
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,320
Joseph!

147
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,160
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.

148
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,760
He says "you'll see, you'll see",
but I still can't see.

149
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,560
It will be...

150
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,680
It will be beautiful.

151
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,840
I'm building it for you.
Are you listening, Alice?

152
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,760
Every day, I picture it.
For years.

153
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,000
The branches, the trees
and the birds instruct me.

154
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,880
Everyone will visit it.

155
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,280
It will be your palace.

156
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,480
A palace?

157
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,600
- And when will you do that?
- In the evenings. At night.

158
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,360
- After my rounds.
- It's ridiculous.

159
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,280
You're not a mason.
It will all collapse.

160
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,080
I know how to make bread.

161
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,520
Mixing lime with water
can't be any more complicated.

162
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,240
You're crazy.
You'll lead us to our deaths.

163
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,960
What'll we eat? Stones?

164
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,280
- Stop this, Joseph. Stop!
- No, I won't stop.

165
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,960
I'm going to make a palace.
That's what I'm going to do.

166
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,480
We will find solutions for the rest.

167
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,200
End of story.

168
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,920
I don't want my daughter's father
to die of cold.

169
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,680
Dad.

170
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,040
Cheval.

171
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,120
Dad...

172
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,440
- What is that animal?
- An elephant.

173
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,800
I've never seen any elephants here.

174
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,800
Could you bring me one
from your rounds? To show me.

175
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,760
No. I can't bring you one.

176
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,880
You know that here, we use horses
to farm the land.

177
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,400
But there, in Asia, look,
they use elephants.

178
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,040
Because they are strong.
They are hard workers.

179
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,480
That's why I'm putting one here.

180
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,920
But it's big.

181
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,080
Lucky there aren't any here,
they'd break my palace.

182
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,440
- No, they are kind animals.
- I don't want elephants here!

183
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,600
Mom, if you see an elephant,
make it leave!

184
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,960
The secret is patience.

185
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,720
Straight ahead, horsey.

186
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,240
Dad.

187
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,120
Dad.

188
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,160
Dad.

189
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,360
Come on. Horsey.

190
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,200
Come on, Dad.

191
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,760
No.

192
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,760
Come on, Dad.

193
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,080
Come on.
Catch me, Dad.

194
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,640
One, two, three.

195
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,520
One, two, three.

196
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,240
Sit. Sit down.

197
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,600
Dad! Hey, Dad.

198
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,760
Hello, father.

199
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,280
I'm going to live in Paris.

200
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,320
I've got a position
with a distinguished tailor.

201
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,720
A good position is important.

202
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,080
- What's your name?
- Alice.

203
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,640
Pleased to meet you, little sister.

204
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,000
I'll come back to see you.

205
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,680
- Well, look who's here.
- Taking a stroll in the village?

206
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,640
- Hello, princess.
- How's the madman's palace?

207
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,520
- My father's not mad.
- The madman's palace.

208
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,240
The madman's palace.

209
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,600
The sultan was a good hunter.

210
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,600
He could kill a rabbit
from over 200 m away,

211
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,240
using only his blowgun.

212
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,640
Then, his falcon flew off
to bring him his prey.

213
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,800
Then...

214
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,880
one evening, as he observed the stars
in the middle of the desert,

215
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,920
he heard...

216
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,200
He heard...

217
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,680
The sultana!

218
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,800
It's always the sultana.
I know your story by heart.

219
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,600
I'm not a little girl anymore.
You're annoying.

220
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,320
Because of you,
the whole village teases me!

221
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,280
- Do you see that star, there?
- Yes.

222
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,880
The very white one. It's Sirius.
It is radiant. It's you.

223
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,760
And over there,
do you see those two?

224
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,200
Yes.

225
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:33,960
That's Philomène and I,
watching over you.

226
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,720
Sirius is the brightest star
in the whole sky.

227
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,800
What about the boy who came
that time, my big brother?

228
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,760
Isn't he there?

229
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,080
Yes, of course. He is...

230
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,240
He's a bit further away.
See? He's there.

231
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,520
Yes.

232
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,880
- Can you see it?
- Yes.

233
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,240
You know,

234
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:10,640
sometimes,
we don't all live together.

235
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,920
I know.

236
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,200
He lives in another region.

237
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,360
Paris.

238
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,760
- Dad?
- Yes.

239
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,680
Even if people in the village
tease me...

240
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,640
I am very happy

241
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,880
with the palace you're building me.

242
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,520
It's the best palace in the world.

243
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,440
Look, you place your needle
under the loop.

244
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,400
- That's it.
- Yes.

245
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,720
Joseph!

246
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,280
Dad.

247
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,560
Joseph?

248
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:42,840
Can you hear me?

249
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,160
Can you hear me?

250
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,240
Joseph.

251
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,840
Two cm closer
and it was your spine, Joseph.

252
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,720
It's a miracle.

253
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,880
And for Alice's cough, rest,

254
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:18,240
and if possible,
some fat in the soup, for strength.

255
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:23,040
Most importantly,
you must wrap up warm, miss.

256
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,400
You're wheezing.

257
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,200
It's a damp winter this year.
You must take care.

258
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,440
Right.

259
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,720
Thank you, Philomène.

260
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,480
Philomène,
he must stop this madness.

261
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,960
It's wearing him out.
Do you tell him that?

262
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,640
He only listens to himself.

263
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,720
Now, you two listen to me.
Stay inside, in the warm.

264
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,800
I don't want to see you outside!

265
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,000
Sorry.

266
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,120
- Hello.
- Hello, little one.

267
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,160
Miss.

268
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

269
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,720
- Are you from the village?
- Yes, why?

270
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,000
Do you know Postman Cheval?

271
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,200
I've heard he's building
a strange castle.

272
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,720
I'm a journalist from Romans.
I've come to visit it.

273
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:03,920
Really?

274
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,640
- Can you take me there?
- If you want. It's this way.

275
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,520
- Does he work alone?
- Yes.

276
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,440
How many hours per day?

277
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:19,240
His postal rounds take about 10 hours,
then, he works here for 10 hours.

278
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,960
- What long days.
- He thinks it's dragging on.

279
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:28,040
This winter he was bedridden
for one month because of an accident.

280
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,640
What is a journalist?

281
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,800
I must write an article about him
for the Romans Gazette.

282
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,400
- This construction is splendid.
- Do you think so?

283
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,720
- It's the best I've seen.
- Even in Romans?

284
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,440
- Even in Valence.
- People around here think he's mad.

285
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,880
Of course, they're uneducated.
They don't understand.

286
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,840
I know.

287
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,320
But you seem smart.

288
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,680
That's normal, my father,
is Joseph Ferdinand Cheval.

289
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,600
Miss Cheval?
What an honor!

290
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,960
- Why didn't you say so before?
- I prefer to be discreet.

291
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,280
Dad!

292
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,680
I've never been to Romans.
Will you take me there?

293
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,320
Please.

294
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,560
A journalist came.

295
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,680
He wanted to see you.

296
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,960
I showed him around the garden
and he wrote an article about you.

297
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,640
- Did you know?
- No.

298
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,480
- Won't you read it?
- It's not the first.

299
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,600
- Really?
- So I'm told.

300
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,680
So, will you take me to Romans?

301
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,200
Yes, we'll go to Romans.

302
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,520
Cyrille?

303
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,560
I'm coming.

304
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,760
It's with emotion
that we're gathered here, today,

305
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,840
to pay homage to Postman Cheval,

306
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,840
for 30 years of loyal service
to the post office.

307
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,720
In total, that's...

308
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,520
Excuse me,
I think there's a small error.

309
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,400
- No.
- Yes, because...

310
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,280
It's correct, I assure you.

311
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,480
So, in total, that is... 222,720 km

312
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,800
travelled along the paths
of Hauterives and Tersanne,

313
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:04,720
which makes 32 km per day,
or five times around the world.

314
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,160
Without leaving the Drôme.

315
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:18,480
I am proud to award you
the post office Medal of Honor.

316
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,320
So, Cheval,
what about this building?

317
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,120
I hope to see it before I leave,
it's partly why I came.

318
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,000
You're famous in the region,
you're a hero.

319
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,360
- How long have you worked on it?
- 13 years.

320
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,400
13 years?

321
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,720
What is it?
A grotto? A sheepfold?

322
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,800
No, it's...

323
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,240
Go on, say it.

324
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,560
A palace.

325
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,000
- A palace.
- A palace?

326
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,680
Where did you get your inspiration?

327
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,280
No, I mean to build it,
how do you do it?

328
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,840
You're a postman, not a mason.

329
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,080
From the fount of creation,
I draw my inspiration.

330
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,400
That's quite impressive.
Is it true?

331
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:50,480
The trees, the wind and the birds
encourage me.

332
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:52,440
Really?

333
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,360
Us locals are strong.

334
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,080
All that you see, passersby,
is the work of a peasant

335
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,960
How is Alice today?

336
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:51,400
- Her cough is severe, very severe.
- And Philomène?

337
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:52,960
She is...

338
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:55,480
She is with her. I must go.

339
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,800
Wait, Cheval.
Come here.

340
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,600
You need these more than me.

341
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,720
She's just gone to sleep.

342
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,040
Her temperature?

343
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,840
- We had to use leeches.
- I said no leeches!

344
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,320
Joseph, we had to.

345
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,520
Earlier,
I thought I was going to lose her.

346
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,320
I'm going to get some wood.

347
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,360
Stay with Alice,
she needs your strength.

348
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,400
You will get better, Alice.

349
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,920
Don't leave me on my own.

350
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:38,760
One evening,
he was observing the stars

351
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:39,920
and he heard...

352
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,120
The...

353
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,160
Yes,

354
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,480
the sultana.

355
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,320
The sultana who danced

356
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,840
all night long

357
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,480
and who...

358
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,120
who made people happy.

359
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,680
Who made the wind hot

360
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,440
and who made the sun...

361
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,200
bright.

362
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,440
What do you mean no? Is it a joke?
Do you want to kill me again?

363
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,880
I'm sorry. Prefectural order.
It's out of my hands.

364
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,640
Prefectural order... my ass!

365
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,160
Alice will be buried
wherever I decide.

366
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:11,720
And I decide
that it'll be in my palace!

367
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,960
I feel your pain, Joseph,
but they won't let you.

368
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,200
Can you imagine?
An exhumation?

369
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,440
- A what?
- They would forcibly dig up the body.

370
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:29,360
I will gather my family
wherever I like.

371
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,280
Wherever I like.

372
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,920
My sincere condolences, father.
These are your granddaughters.

373
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,880
Eugénie.

374
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,560
And...

375
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,840
little...

376
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,000
Alice.

377
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,960
We should go home.

378
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,240
You want to die, Cheval, is that it?

379
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:16,960
Don't worry,

380
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:21,800
if you carry on this way, soon
the Grim Reaper will take you to Alice.

381
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,880
That's what you want, isn't it?

382
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,600
Tell her that I love her
more and more.

383
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,800
Tell her that life here is unbearable
and that the house is empty.

384
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,320
You'll tell her?

385
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,880
Tell her my body is broken
and I can no longer breathe.

386
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,560
Alright?

387
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,720
And tell her that Cyrille
named his daughter after her.

388
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,520
Did you see Alice?

389
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,720
She looks like our Alice
at the same age.

390
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,600
That same determined look.

391
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,280
That's from your side.

392
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,320
Have you noticed...

393
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,320
the grotto has collapsed
since you stopped working?

394
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,040
Alice loved hiding in it so much.

395
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,600
I'm going to get some wood.

396
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,840
I must finish it.

397
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,520
You are...

398
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:04,640
Impressive.

399
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:09,080
Where did you learn
those architectural techniques?

400
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,880
Excuse-me. Let me introduce myself,
Joseph Cadier.

401
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,440
I've just returned to the region
after a little trip.

402
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,640
Where were you?

403
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,640
In New York for a while, then Boston,

404
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,720
Sweden, Russia...

405
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,800
I've been away for 25 years.

406
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:34,000
- I've heard about you.
- Me too.

407
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:37,520
As soon as I arrived,
my curiosity brought me straight here.

408
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,000
Everyone speaks about your work.

409
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:47,840
How do you get such curved shapes
to hold at that height?

410
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,680
I used a metal framework.

411
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,880
Who gave you that idea?

412
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,440
I gave it some thought.

413
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,360
We will live
at my grandfather's house.

414
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:12,160
- Hauterives needs a good tailor.
- That's true.

415
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,520
Do you think it will make him happy?

416
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,800
Dreyfus is a puppet.

417
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:28,120
An anonymous letter,
it's a bit feeble, isn't it?

418
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:33,200
But the wretch is reserved,
taciturn, unpopular.

419
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,280
An ideal culprit.

420
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,760
I know the type.

421
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,280
Joseph!

422
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,520
Cyrille and his family are coming
to live in Hauterives and...

423
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:51,960
he's opening a workshop.
Isn't that good news?

424
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:00,160
I finished my training,
and I thought that you'd...

425
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,200
That people always need
a good tailor.

426
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:15,160
Oh yes! Elegance,
that's a real art, too.

427
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:22,480
Perhaps.

428
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,400
Well done for your training.

429
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,560
It's basalt.

430
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:48,280
The statues stand up
to three meters high.

431
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:52,240
- They are called "Moai".
- Easter Island.

432
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:57,240
On the East facade.
They would guard the entrance. No?

433
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,080
I'll think about it.

434
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,080
I'll be off.
I've another 28 km to go.

435
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,640
- I have 3,000 km.
- What?

436
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,640
I'm going travelling again.

437
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:38,760
I'm not alone.

438
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:42,160
Alice, look.

439
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,360
Not alone.

440
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,120
Alice!

441
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,520
Look!

442
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,920
Have you seen
how well it's progressing?

443
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,040
I've built three new vaults.

444
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:09,000
The fairies from the east
will befriend those of the west.

445
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:14,960
Princess Daoud whispered
that in my ear, while I was sleeping.

446
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,640
Do you like it, Alice?

447
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:22,760
Alice...

448
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,240
There, Cadier.

449
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:33,800
Do you like it?

450
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:26,720
To achieve your goal
you must be stubborn

451
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,120
Can I help you?

452
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:41,320
Have you been waiting for long?

453
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:45,960
A while.

454
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,400
Pass me the trowel.

455
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,440
The small one.

456
01:11:58,680 --> 01:11:59,680
This one?

457
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,760
No, both of them.

458
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,360
It's called a "cat's tongue".

459
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:23,080
You can come and help me.

460
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,760
But don't come to bother me.

461
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
"It was around 10 pm,

462
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,840
"when, alerted by the cries
of Marguerite Steinheil,

463
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,960
"the chief of staff found the
President of the Republic, Félix Faure,

464
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:33,240
"exceptionally virile,
agonizing on the couch,

465
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,400
"dressed in a simple flannel vest.

466
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:39,520
"Next to him, his mistress, in tears,
was hurriedly getting dressed."

467
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:44,120
Rich men's mistresses
always cry in the end.

468
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,160
Joseph...

469
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,400
Hello, young man.

470
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,280
Why do I find him
too sharply dressed?

471
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,160
Hello, father.

472
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,480
Let me introduce my friend,
Louis Charvat.

473
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:31,720
Louis, my father
and his wife, Philomène.

474
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,400
And that's Garance.

475
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,600
Louis wants to photograph
your palace

476
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:42,160
and to make illustrated
postcards of the photos.

477
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:46,520
Postcards?
Explain it to us.

478
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,880
My camera obscura
can take five photographs per day.

479
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,960
With the help of a printer,
we could make 100 postcards.

480
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:01,120
If we sell them for five centimes,
we could quickly make up to 100 francs.

481
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,640
That's a tidy sum.

482
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:13,520
And your palace could be seen
all over the world.

483
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,360
So, what do you say?

484
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,520
Are there any onions left?

485
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,480
He's happy.

486
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,200
It lacks life.

487
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:01,120
My palace lacks life?

488
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:05,640
No, I mean... it might be better
with a figure in front.

489
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,080
On the staircase or the terraces.

490
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:13,200
Go on.

491
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,200
Go on.

492
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:17,400
Never.

493
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:22,080
Cyrille,
you go.

494
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,160
Go on, Cyrille.

495
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:53,520
Yes, that's much better.

496
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,640
And one...

497
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,200
And two...

498
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:09,760
You annoy me, you old grouch.
Go on, you're dying to.

499
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,680
And three...

500
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,840
Don't move.

501
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:33,000
Ready...

502
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:35,560
Perfect.

503
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,400
Alice.

504
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,360
Alice!

505
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,840
Where is Alice?

506
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,960
- Where is your daughter?
- Girls?

507
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:36,800
Your palace is amazing, grandfather.

508
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,000
When I meet my prince charming,
I'll marry him here.

509
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:42,160
That's nice, darling. Come.

510
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:09,400
The Story of the Ideal Palace.

511
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:49,800
It's...

512
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,880
It's your son.

513
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,880
I didn't have time to tell him.

514
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:00,680
He waited for so long.

515
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,560
Joseph.

516
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,000
- Have you nearly finished your palace?
- Not yet.

517
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,680
I'll know when I've reached the end.

518
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,720
I'm not there yet.

519
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:34,320
The man over there
wants to offer you a drink.

520
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:37,600
He's come from Nice,
just to see your palace.

521
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:46,920
How old are you, now?

522
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,000
44 years old, Mr. Cheval.

523
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:53,520
I see.

524
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,200
A glass of water.

525
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:06,960
I'm thirsty.

526
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:26,240
- Nice.
- What?

527
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:28,680
Nothing.

528
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:37,320
The other day,
a gentleman came from Milan.

529
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:44,600
And I received a letter
from an American.

530
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,160
- Enjoy your visit.
- Thank you.

531
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,240
War has been declared!

532
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,040
The Germans are invading Lorraine!

533
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,080
War has been declared!

534
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:35,200
The Germans are invading Lorraine!

535
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,840
Do you think I'm going to die?

536
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:13,080
Yes.

537
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:15,840
I think so.

538
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,240
I think so.

539
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,840
You made me happy.

540
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,880
I wasn't made for this world.

541
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:59,640
I wouldn't have survived it without you.
You found me.

542
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:02,880
You gave me confidence.

543
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,240
You gave me Alice.

544
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,960
You even picked me up
when I wanted to die.

545
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:23,840
This palace,
Philomène,

546
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,360
is also yours.

547
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,000
Philomène...

548
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,320
What do you think about
as you walk?

549
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:06,880
See you tomorrow,
Postman Cheval.

550
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,600
These are your granddaughters.

551
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:12,000
Eugénie,

552
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:14,960
and... little Alice.

553
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,640
Mom, if you see an elephant,
make it go away!

554
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:22,160
Dad. Hey, Dad.

555
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:27,280
Tell her that I love her a bit more
every day, won't you?

556
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,080
You'll tell her?

557
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:36,240
I'm very happy
with the palace you're building me.

558
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:39,080
It's the best palace in the world.

559
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,520
- What on earth is he doing?
- He's lost his mind again.

560
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:54,440
Apparently he is building
a tomb for his daughter.

561
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:14,680
Grandfather?

562
01:30:42,200 --> 01:30:43,400
My granddaughter.

563
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:46,960
Grandfather, this is Eugène.

564
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:56,680
Sir, I'm very honored to meet you.

565
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,680
We are going to get married.

566
01:31:08,360 --> 01:31:10,240
Will you come to the wedding?

567
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,680
With your prince charming.

568
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:16,600
Will you come?

569
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:20,120
What time will it be?

570
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:41,480
33 years, 9 thousand days,
65 thousand hours for my Palace.

571
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:46,400
8 years for the tomb.
Work completed, September 22, 1923.

572
01:32:18,640 --> 01:32:20,080
Hello, Félicienne.

573
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:26,000
Have you finished, Cheval?

574
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:36,080
What will you do now, Cheval?

575
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:39,360
Join them.

576
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:07,200
Here, Cheval, a flower for you.

577
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:57,960
Look what I found
when I cleared the house.

578
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:06,000
It was father's.
Your son.

579
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,640
Dad, come and dance.

580
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:03,080
I'm coming.

581
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:34,880
Joseph Ferdinand Cheval
died in 1924, at the age of 88.

582
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:38,560
He devoted 33 years of his life
to building the "Ideal Palace",

583
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:41,160
which represents
93,000 hours of work.

584
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:45,800
On November 9,1968,
André Malraux, Minister of Culture,

585
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:49,280
declared Postman Cheval's
Ideal Palace an historic monument,

586
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:52,520
"we are lucky to have the only
naive architecture in the world."
