THE IDEAL PALACE

3
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:02,017
<i>a film by Nils Tavernier</i>

4
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:07,350
<i>1873 in the Drôme</i>

5
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,642
Here, Joseph.

6
00:02:29,892 --> 00:02:31,267
For your collection.

7
00:02:32,892 --> 00:02:36,225
You can keep it.
The name is illegible.

8
00:03:52,392 --> 00:03:53,517
Joseph,

9
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:55,225
I know that the world...

10
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:57,225
the world of people scares you.

11
00:03:58,225 --> 00:03:59,475
But you must come.

12
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:04,975
Come on now.

13
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:09,433
For Rosalie. For your son.

14
00:04:48,058 --> 00:04:52,517
We are gathered here, this afternoon,
to bid farewell to Rosalie Cheval,

15
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:53,642
née Rosalie Revol,

16
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,350
wife of Joseph Ferdinand Cheval,
postal employee,

17
00:04:57,392 --> 00:04:59,767
and mother of Cyrille Cheval.

18
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:36,517
Victoire and I are too old
to look after our grandson.

19
00:05:37,308 --> 00:05:40,350
He will go to Lyon,
to live with his aunt and uncle.

20
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:48,600
How will you do your rounds?

21
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,892
What will you do with the lad?

22
00:05:52,392 --> 00:05:53,642
End of story.

23
00:06:02,183 --> 00:06:04,767
Cyrille, go say goodbye
to your father.

24
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:11,850
Hurry up.

25
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,475
Say goodbye.

26
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,558
Goodbye, Dad.

27
00:07:16,058 --> 00:07:17,600
- Auguste.
- Yes?

28
00:07:17,642 --> 00:07:18,850
Can you take it for me?

29
00:07:18,892 --> 00:07:22,350
Of course. But why do you
always bring me your post?

30
00:07:22,392 --> 00:07:25,225
Cheval passes your house
every day.

31
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:26,725
You saw it yourself.

32
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:29,683
He didn't even shed a tear
for Rosalie.

33
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:31,350
He's an animal.

34
00:07:31,392 --> 00:07:33,433
He just doesn't have any tears left.

35
00:07:33,475 --> 00:07:34,767
Well, he scares me.

36
00:07:34,808 --> 00:07:38,267
Listen, Félicienne,
that's just the way he is...

37
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:40,767
withdrawn.

38
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:45,350
"Extraordinary discovery

39
00:07:45,392 --> 00:07:49,267
in the Cambodian jungle:

40
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:51,767
the temples

41
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:54,975
of Angkor."

42
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:56,767
"Angkor."

43
00:08:21,975 --> 00:08:23,100
Hello.

44
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:26,225
Which way to Rufus Comblet's house?

45
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:30,892
Behind the house, follow the path,
turn right at the crossing.

46
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:36,267
Are you new?

47
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,308
I've never seen you before.

48
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:42,558
Philomène Richaud.

49
00:08:43,183 --> 00:08:44,600
Postman Cheval.

50
00:08:46,142 --> 00:08:47,808
They've extended my rounds.

51
00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:51,392
Wait.

52
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,475
It's a steep path to the Comblet's.

53
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:23,517
More?

54
00:09:37,892 --> 00:09:39,475
What do you think about as you walk?

55
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:46,017
It must take a long time.

56
00:09:48,517 --> 00:09:49,600
Well, thank you.

57
00:09:51,183 --> 00:09:52,267
I'll be off.

58
00:09:54,058 --> 00:09:56,058
See you tomorrow, Postman Cheval.

59
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:01,475
Right at the crossing!

60
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,475
Did you see widow Richaud?

61
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:18,475
Yes.

62
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,183
How is she doing up there?

63
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,183
I don't know.

64
00:10:24,267 --> 00:10:25,308
She's alone.

65
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,642
I dream.

66
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:15,517
Pardon?

67
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,558
The other day, you asked me
what I do when I walk.

68
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,892
Well, I dream.

69
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:26,100
- And you don't get bored?
- No.

70
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:28,475
I'm happy when I walk.

71
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:36,100
Earlier, I was imagining
building a house in the forest,

72
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:38,975
with branches, leaves and flowers.

73
00:11:41,725 --> 00:11:43,683
It must be a pretty house.

74
00:11:50,183 --> 00:11:52,392
Have you heard of the Mayan temples?

75
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:54,850
No.

76
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:57,517
There are some
in <i>Picturesque magazine.</i>

77
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,267
Are you hurt?

78
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:05,808
No, it's nothing.

79
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:08,600
No, it's not nothing, it's...

80
00:12:09,225 --> 00:12:10,308
It's infected.

81
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,225
It's... empty.

82
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:53,600
What more does it need?

83
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:57,017
A little sweep, perhaps.

84
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:03,642
The bed by the window...

85
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:10,100
I like it.

86
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,350
I have some pale red fabric left.
It will look nice here.

87
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:44,517
It's so beautiful.

88
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:09,100
Where did you learn to do that?

89
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:12,267
I was an apprentice baker

90
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:15,017
in Romans, in Valence.

91
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:18,017
The important thing is your palm.

92
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:21,850
You must forget your fingers.

93
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:27,725
- Can I taste it?
- No, that's not allowed.

94
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:37,850
It's better like that.

95
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:40,642
Taste it.

96
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:44,850
Go on, taste it.

97
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:06,100
I have some handsome eggplants.

98
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,933
And some zucchini over there.

99
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:11,725
I even have some sage.

100
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:12,975
How lucky!

101
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:14,808
You'll have food this winter.

102
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:18,725
- They say it'll be harsh.
- I heard.

103
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:19,808
Thank you.

104
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,808
What does your Joseph think of it?

105
00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:26,475
He hasn't said anything yet.

106
00:17:27,808 --> 00:17:29,933
He was never a big talker, your man.

107
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,517
He's certainly not a chatterbox.

108
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:34,683
Leave the big talkers
to the village vipers.

109
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:38,725
I know what people say
about my Joseph.

110
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,767
They say I'm married to a simpleton.

111
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,558
But I know he's different.
He's a good person.

112
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:48,433
He may not talk, my Joseph,
but he acts.

113
00:17:49,683 --> 00:17:52,392
- Already?
- Yes. Can you believe it?

114
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,433
I'm sorry, forgive me.

115
00:17:59,308 --> 00:18:02,308
No. Don't apologize.

116
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,725
As long as I have my fabrics
and my dresses to make...

117
00:18:07,642 --> 00:18:10,017
And I'm really happy for you.

118
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,433
- Does Joseph know?
- Not yet.

119
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:17,725
- He'll be happy.
- Yes, I think so.

120
00:18:56,517 --> 00:18:58,100
What are you doing here?

121
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:05,975
Goodbye, Auguste.

122
00:19:06,642 --> 00:19:07,767
Goodbye, Félicienne.

123
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:08,933
Come on dog.

124
00:19:19,183 --> 00:19:20,433
What are you fretting about?

125
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:27,808
Philomène is with child.

126
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:33,017
Congratulations.

127
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:36,350
Don't.

128
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:40,350
But Joseph, you should be happy.

129
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:43,183
You'll even get a bonus
from the post office.

130
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:44,267
It's not that.

131
00:19:50,475 --> 00:19:53,183
I don't know what to do
with children.

132
00:19:56,392 --> 00:19:58,058
Philomène will resent that.

133
00:19:59,308 --> 00:20:01,933
No, she won't, don't worry.

134
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:07,892
Anyway, it's not a man's job
to look after the children.

135
00:20:09,183 --> 00:20:10,808
Go on, go home.

136
00:20:12,683 --> 00:20:15,350
I'll take breaks. Longer breaks.

137
00:20:15,392 --> 00:20:17,600
That's what I'll do, take breaks.

138
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,142
I'll take breaks.

139
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:06,142
Cheval!

140
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:14,308
It's a girl.

141
00:22:14,017 --> 00:22:16,267
Don't you want me
to make you something else?

142
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,725
Turnips? Carrots?

143
00:22:24,392 --> 00:22:26,600
You eat the same thing every day.

144
00:22:26,642 --> 00:22:28,225
It's good for the heart.

145
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,225
You'll get ill.

146
00:22:56,892 --> 00:22:58,058
Are you hungry?

147
00:22:58,892 --> 00:22:59,933
Yes.

148
00:23:25,642 --> 00:23:28,433
Yes. Give me a smile.

149
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:29,975
Give me a smile.

150
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:31,892
Go on, a smile.

151
00:23:33,267 --> 00:23:34,350
My princess.

152
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,683
Come here. We're nice and comfy.

153
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,892
Philomène!

154
00:24:25,517 --> 00:24:28,058
I've just finished the dress.
Come up.

155
00:24:32,392 --> 00:24:35,308
If you'd try it on,
it'll help me with the trimmings.

156
00:24:40,725 --> 00:24:41,808
I'll be back.

157
00:26:36,725 --> 00:26:38,308
What are you doing?

158
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,142
She...

159
00:26:44,058 --> 00:26:45,183
She was crying.

160
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,975
She's pretty, isn't she?

161
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:40,767
Why did you bring this rock home?

162
00:28:40,808 --> 00:28:42,433
It almost killed you.

163
00:28:44,142 --> 00:28:46,142
I'm warning you, this will sting.

164
00:29:46,725 --> 00:29:47,808
Joseph!

165
00:31:28,642 --> 00:31:30,558
What is he doing?

166
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,808
I don't know.

167
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,642
He says "you'll see, you'll see",
but I still can't see.

168
00:31:39,183 --> 00:31:40,475
It will be...

169
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:43,725
It will be beautiful.

170
00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:47,975
I'm building it for you.
Are you listening, Alice?

171
00:31:48,017 --> 00:31:49,892
Every day, I picture it.

172
00:31:49,933 --> 00:31:51,100
For years.

173
00:31:51,725 --> 00:31:55,683
The branches, the trees
and the birds instruct me.

174
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:56,600
Everyone will visit it.

175
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:02,475
It will be your palace.

176
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:09,558
A palace?

177
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:20,267
And when will you do that?

178
00:32:20,308 --> 00:32:22,183
In the evenings. At night.

179
00:32:22,933 --> 00:32:24,183
After my rounds.

180
00:32:24,642 --> 00:32:26,100
It's ridiculous.

181
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,017
You're not a mason.
It will all collapse.

182
00:32:31,058 --> 00:32:33,225
I know how to make bread.

183
00:32:33,267 --> 00:32:36,808
Mixing lime with water
can't be any more complicated.

184
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,642
You're crazy.
You'll lead us to our deaths.

185
00:32:39,683 --> 00:32:42,433
What'll we eat? Stones?

186
00:32:44,933 --> 00:32:46,767
Stop this, Joseph. Stop!

187
00:32:46,808 --> 00:32:48,933
No, I won't stop.

188
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:53,892
I'm going to make a palace.
That's what I'm going to do.

189
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:57,558
We will find solutions for the rest.

190
00:32:58,725 --> 00:33:00,392
End of story.

191
00:34:22,225 --> 00:34:25,433
I don't want my daughter's father
to die of cold.

192
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:09,892
Dad.

193
00:37:17,433 --> 00:37:18,517
Cheval.

194
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,517
Dad...

195
00:37:44,975 --> 00:37:46,100
What is that animal?

196
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:48,058
An elephant.

197
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,225
I've never seen any elephants here.

198
00:37:52,558 --> 00:37:56,017
Could you bring me one
from your rounds? To show me.

199
00:37:56,058 --> 00:37:58,850
No. I can't bring you one.

200
00:38:00,892 --> 00:38:04,850
You know that here,
we use horses

201
00:38:05,392 --> 00:38:07,767
to farm the land.

202
00:38:07,808 --> 00:38:12,142
But there, in Asia, look,
they use elephants.

203
00:38:12,183 --> 00:38:15,933
Because they are strong.
They are hard workers.

204
00:38:15,975 --> 00:38:17,267
That's why I'm putting one here.

205
00:38:18,558 --> 00:38:19,517
But it's big.

206
00:38:20,183 --> 00:38:23,225
Lucky there aren't any here,
they'd break my palace.

207
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:26,558
No, they are kind animals.

208
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,725
I don't want elephants here!

209
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:31,975
Mom, if you see an elephant,
make it leave!

210
00:38:41,892 --> 00:38:43,850
The secret is patience.

211
00:38:45,308 --> 00:38:46,725
Straight ahead, horsey.

212
00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:01,683
Dad.

213
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:03,808
Dad.

214
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:09,892
Come on. Horsey.

215
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:12,267
Come on, Dad.

216
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:13,808
No.

217
00:39:15,725 --> 00:39:16,975
Come on, Dad.

218
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:19,433
Come on.

219
00:39:19,475 --> 00:39:21,600
Catch me, Dad.

220
00:39:21,642 --> 00:39:23,308
One, two, three.

221
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,058
One, two, three.

222
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,933
Sit. Sit down.

223
00:40:17,183 --> 00:40:19,308
Dad! Hey, Dad.

224
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,058
Hello, father.

225
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,017
I'm going to live in Paris.

226
00:40:43,725 --> 00:40:46,183
I've got a position
with a distinguished tailor.

227
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:50,308
A good position

228
00:40:51,267 --> 00:40:52,850
is important.

229
00:40:55,058 --> 00:40:56,433
What's your name?

230
00:40:57,308 --> 00:40:58,350
Alice.

231
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:02,058
Pleased to meet you,
little sister.

232
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,100
I'll come back to see you.

233
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:43,142
Well, look who's here.

234
00:41:44,183 --> 00:41:46,100
Taking a stroll in the village?

235
00:41:46,142 --> 00:41:47,808
Hello, princess.

236
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,142
How's the madman's palace?

237
00:41:49,183 --> 00:41:50,100
My father's not mad.

238
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:54,225
The madman's palace.
The madman's palace.

239
00:41:54,267 --> 00:41:57,933
The madman's palace.
The madman's palace.

240
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,892
The sultan was a good hunter.

241
00:42:13,558 --> 00:42:17,017
He could kill a rabbit
from over 200 m away,

242
00:42:17,683 --> 00:42:19,767
using only his blowgun.

243
00:42:21,392 --> 00:42:23,350
Then, his falcon flew off

244
00:42:24,683 --> 00:42:26,433
to bring him his prey.

245
00:42:27,558 --> 00:42:28,683
Then...

246
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,933
one evening, as he observed the stars
in the middle of the desert,

247
00:42:34,767 --> 00:42:36,058
he heard...

248
00:42:37,142 --> 00:42:37,975
He heard...

249
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,100
The sultana!

250
00:42:40,142 --> 00:42:43,475
It's always the sultana.
I know your story by heart.

251
00:42:43,517 --> 00:42:46,392
I'm not a little girl anymore.
You're annoying.

252
00:42:46,433 --> 00:42:49,058
Because of you,
the whole village teases me!

253
00:43:02,058 --> 00:43:04,725
- Do you see that star, there?
- Yes.

254
00:43:04,767 --> 00:43:07,100
The very white one. It's Sirius.

255
00:43:07,142 --> 00:43:09,642
It is radiant. It's you.

256
00:43:09,683 --> 00:43:12,475
And over there,
do you see those two?

257
00:43:12,517 --> 00:43:13,975
Yes.

258
00:43:14,017 --> 00:43:17,308
That's Philomène and I,

259
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,808
watching over you.

260
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:24,808
Sirius is the brightest star
in the whole sky.

261
00:43:27,558 --> 00:43:32,183
What about the boy who came
that time, my big brother?

262
00:43:33,017 --> 00:43:34,225
Isn't he there?

263
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,767
Yes, of course. He is...

264
00:43:40,225 --> 00:43:43,350
He's a bit further away.
See? He's there.

265
00:43:43,392 --> 00:43:44,433
Oh yes.

266
00:43:46,183 --> 00:43:47,933
- Can you see it?
- Yes.

267
00:43:50,308 --> 00:43:51,433
You know,

268
00:43:52,725 --> 00:43:53,892
sometimes,

269
00:43:54,975 --> 00:43:57,142
we don't all live together.

270
00:43:57,183 --> 00:43:58,350
I know.

271
00:44:00,683 --> 00:44:02,808
He lives in another region.

272
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:05,058
Paris.

273
00:44:10,267 --> 00:44:12,767
- Dad?
- Yes.

274
00:44:15,058 --> 00:44:17,892
Even if people in the village
tease me...

275
00:44:22,475 --> 00:44:24,142
I am very happy

276
00:44:25,517 --> 00:44:27,475
with the palace you're building me.

277
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:30,267
It's the best palace in the world.

278
00:45:07,142 --> 00:45:10,808
Look, you place your needle
under the loop.

279
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:12,850
- That's it.
- Oh yes.

280
00:45:19,308 --> 00:45:20,433
Joseph!

281
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:28,558
Dad.

282
00:45:29,558 --> 00:45:30,683
Joseph?

283
00:45:31,933 --> 00:45:33,058
Can you hear me?

284
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:36,517
Can you hear me?

285
00:45:40,517 --> 00:45:41,808
Joseph.

286
00:45:55,017 --> 00:45:58,058
2 cm closer
and it was your spine, Joseph.

287
00:45:58,683 --> 00:46:00,017
It's a miracle.

288
00:46:04,058 --> 00:46:06,558
And for Alice's cough, rest,

289
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,267
and if possible, some fat
in the soup, for strength.

290
00:46:10,183 --> 00:46:14,933
Most importantly,
you must wrap up warm, miss.

291
00:46:15,808 --> 00:46:17,392
You're wheezing.

292
00:46:18,767 --> 00:46:22,517
It's a damp winter this year.
You must take care.

293
00:46:22,558 --> 00:46:23,683
Right.

294
00:46:31,975 --> 00:46:33,392
Thank you, Philomène.

295
00:46:43,642 --> 00:46:46,767
Philomène,
he must stop this madness.

296
00:46:47,642 --> 00:46:50,350
It's wearing him out.
Do you tell him that?

297
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:52,142
He only listens to himself.

298
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,850
Now, you two listen to me.
Stay inside, in the warm.

299
00:47:07,892 --> 00:47:09,892
I don't want to see you outside!

300
00:47:22,558 --> 00:47:23,642
Sorry.

301
00:47:31,517 --> 00:47:33,267
- Hello.
- Hello, little one.

302
00:47:40,183 --> 00:47:40,975
Miss.

303
00:47:42,225 --> 00:47:43,683
- Hello.
- Hello.

304
00:47:43,725 --> 00:47:46,267
- Are you from the village?
- Yes, why?

305
00:47:49,017 --> 00:47:50,725
Do you know Postman Cheval?

306
00:47:53,058 --> 00:47:55,267
I've heard he's building
a strange castle.

307
00:47:56,058 --> 00:47:58,933
I'm a journalist from Romans.
I've come to visit it.

308
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,058
Really?

309
00:48:01,975 --> 00:48:05,058
- Can you take me there?
- If you want. It's this way.

310
00:48:07,433 --> 00:48:09,267
- Does he work alone?
- Yes.

311
00:48:09,308 --> 00:48:11,142
How many hours per day?

312
00:48:11,183 --> 00:48:13,850
His postal rounds
take about 10 hours,

313
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:16,100
then, he works here for 10 hours.

314
00:48:16,975 --> 00:48:18,475
What long days.

315
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,017
He thinks it's dragging on.

316
00:48:21,058 --> 00:48:25,142
This winter he was bedridden
for 1 month because of an accident.

317
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,225
What is a journalist?

318
00:48:30,267 --> 00:48:33,350
I must write an article about him
for the Romans Gazette.

319
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,142
This construction is splendid.

320
00:48:40,183 --> 00:48:41,267
Do you think so?

321
00:48:42,225 --> 00:48:43,142
It's the best I've seen.

322
00:48:43,558 --> 00:48:44,683
Even in Romans?

323
00:48:45,392 --> 00:48:46,600
Even in Valence.

324
00:48:47,392 --> 00:48:49,808
People around here think he's mad.

325
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:53,183
Of course, they're uneducated.
They don't understand.

326
00:48:54,142 --> 00:48:55,225
I know.

327
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:58,017
But you seem smart.

328
00:48:58,058 --> 00:48:59,600
That's normal,

329
00:48:59,642 --> 00:49:02,392
my father
is Joseph Ferdinand Cheval.

330
00:49:02,808 --> 00:49:04,225
Miss Cheval?

331
00:49:05,183 --> 00:49:06,642
What an honor!

332
00:49:06,683 --> 00:49:08,975
Why didn't you say so before?

333
00:49:09,017 --> 00:49:11,017
I prefer to be discreet.

334
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,392
Dad! Dad!

335
00:49:14,558 --> 00:49:18,017
I've never been to Romans.
Will you take me there?

336
00:49:18,558 --> 00:49:19,725
Please.

337
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,100
A journalist came.

338
00:49:24,058 --> 00:49:25,308
He wanted to see you.

339
00:49:26,142 --> 00:49:29,933
I showed him around the garden
and he wrote an article about you.

340
00:49:29,975 --> 00:49:31,475
- Did you know?
- No.

341
00:49:32,308 --> 00:49:34,558
- Won't you read it?
- It's not the first.

342
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,642
- Really?
- So I'm told.

343
00:49:39,808 --> 00:49:41,933
So, will you take me to Romans?

344
00:49:44,225 --> 00:49:45,600
Yes, we'll go to Romans.

345
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,142
Cyrille?

346
00:50:22,267 --> 00:50:23,350
I'm coming.

347
00:50:32,642 --> 00:50:35,225
It's with emotion
that we're gathered here, today,

348
00:50:35,267 --> 00:50:36,850
to pay homage to Postman Cheval,

349
00:50:37,683 --> 00:50:40,392
for 30 years of loyal service
to the post office.

350
00:50:41,892 --> 00:50:43,392
In total, that's...

351
00:50:45,392 --> 00:50:47,517
Excuse me,
I think there's a small error.

352
00:50:47,558 --> 00:50:49,475
- No.
- Yes, because...

353
00:50:49,517 --> 00:50:51,267
It's correct, I assure you.

354
00:50:53,892 --> 00:50:58,767
So, in total, that is...
222,720 km

355
00:50:59,392 --> 00:51:02,767
travelled along the paths
of Hauterives and Tersanne,

356
00:51:03,433 --> 00:51:05,392
which makes 32 km per day,

357
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:08,517
or 5 times around the world.

358
00:51:08,558 --> 00:51:09,600
Without leaving the Drôme.

359
00:51:18,392 --> 00:51:22,725
I am proud to award you
the post office Medal of Honor.

360
00:51:36,558 --> 00:51:39,267
So, Cheval,
what about this building?

361
00:51:41,142 --> 00:51:44,267
I hope to see it before I leave,
it's partly why I came.

362
00:51:45,808 --> 00:51:47,933
You're famous in the region,
you're a hero.

363
00:51:49,433 --> 00:51:50,933
How long have you worked on it?

364
00:51:50,975 --> 00:51:51,808
13 years.

365
00:51:52,683 --> 00:51:53,933
13 years?

366
00:51:54,683 --> 00:51:58,433
What is it? A grotto?
A sheepfold?

367
00:52:02,933 --> 00:52:05,808
No, it's...

368
00:52:09,183 --> 00:52:10,433
Go on, say it.

369
00:52:14,933 --> 00:52:15,975
A palace.

370
00:52:17,225 --> 00:52:18,142
A palace.

371
00:52:18,558 --> 00:52:19,558
A palace?

372
00:52:20,308 --> 00:52:22,350
Where did you get your inspiration?

373
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:42,933
No, I mean to build it,
how do you do it?

374
00:52:42,975 --> 00:52:44,517
You're a postman, not a mason.

375
00:52:44,558 --> 00:52:47,767
From the fount of creation,
I draw my inspiration.

376
00:52:49,892 --> 00:52:51,267
That's quite impressive.

377
00:52:52,267 --> 00:52:54,225
Is it true?

378
00:52:54,267 --> 00:52:57,433
The trees, the wind and the birds

379
00:52:57,475 --> 00:52:58,600
encourage me.

380
00:52:59,517 --> 00:53:00,517
Really?

381
00:53:02,017 --> 00:53:03,683
Us locals are strong.

382
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:45,058
<i>All that you see, passersby,
is the work of a peasant</i>

383
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,433
How is Alice today?

384
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,850
Her cough is severe, very severe.

385
00:54:00,892 --> 00:54:02,058
And Philomène?

386
00:54:02,683 --> 00:54:03,683
She is...

387
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,475
She is with her. I must go.

388
00:54:06,517 --> 00:54:07,767
Wait, Cheval.

389
00:54:08,642 --> 00:54:09,767
Come here.

390
00:54:11,808 --> 00:54:13,725
You need these more than me.

391
00:54:49,725 --> 00:54:52,392
She's just gone to sleep.

392
00:55:02,017 --> 00:55:03,100
Her temperature?

393
00:55:04,933 --> 00:55:06,808
We had to use leeches.

394
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:09,183
I said no leeches!

395
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:11,767
Joseph, we had to.

396
00:55:13,725 --> 00:55:16,142
Earlier,
I thought I was going to lose her.

397
00:55:19,517 --> 00:55:21,225
I'm going to get some wood.

398
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:25,350
Stay with Alice,
she needs your strength.

399
00:56:05,308 --> 00:56:07,058
You will get better, Alice.

400
00:56:10,183 --> 00:56:11,767
Don't leave me on my own.

401
00:56:51,558 --> 00:56:52,933
One evening,

402
00:56:52,975 --> 00:56:56,517
he was observing the stars

403
00:56:56,558 --> 00:56:57,725
and he heard...

404
00:56:57,767 --> 00:56:58,600
The...

405
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:05,100
Yes,

406
00:57:06,183 --> 00:57:07,642
the sultana.

407
00:57:07,683 --> 00:57:09,350
The sultana who danced

408
00:57:10,892 --> 00:57:12,058
all night long

409
00:57:13,683 --> 00:57:14,850
and who...

410
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:18,642
who made people happy.

411
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:23,517
Who made the wind hot

412
00:57:23,558 --> 00:57:26,267
and who made the sun...

413
00:57:28,058 --> 00:57:29,142
bright.

414
00:59:19,308 --> 00:59:23,100
What do you mean no? Is it a joke?
Do you want to kill me again?

415
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:26,683
I'm sorry. Prefectural order.
It's out of my hands.

416
00:59:26,725 --> 00:59:28,350
Prefectural order... my ass!

417
00:59:29,892 --> 00:59:33,183
Alice will be buried wherever I decide.

418
00:59:33,225 --> 00:59:35,725
And I decide
that it'll be in my palace!

419
00:59:36,267 --> 00:59:39,350
I feel your pain, Joseph,
but they won't let you.

420
00:59:39,392 --> 00:59:41,600
Can you imagine?
An exhumation?

421
00:59:41,642 --> 00:59:42,933
A what?

422
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:44,808
They would forcibly dig up the body.

423
00:59:49,642 --> 00:59:51,850
I will gather my family

424
00:59:52,808 --> 00:59:54,142
wherever I like.

425
00:59:56,725 --> 00:59:58,225
Wherever I like.

426
01:00:53,392 --> 01:00:55,225
My sincere condolences, father.

427
01:00:55,683 --> 01:00:57,183
These are your granddaughters.

428
01:00:59,225 --> 01:01:00,350
Eugénie.

429
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,142
And...

430
01:01:04,267 --> 01:01:05,517
little...

431
01:01:06,517 --> 01:01:07,392
Alice.

432
01:01:11,642 --> 01:01:13,350
We should go home.

433
01:02:43,642 --> 01:02:45,933
<i>You want to die, Cheval, is that it?</i>

434
01:02:47,183 --> 01:02:48,808
<i>Don't worry,</i>

435
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:53,558
if you carry on this way, soon
the Grim Reaper will take you to Alice.

436
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,600
That's what you want, isn't it?

437
01:02:58,183 --> 01:03:00,767
Tell her that I love her
more and more.

438
01:03:03,183 --> 01:03:05,642
Tell her that life here
is unbearable

439
01:03:05,683 --> 01:03:07,392
and that the house is empty.

440
01:03:08,558 --> 01:03:09,850
You'll tell her?

441
01:03:14,392 --> 01:03:17,725
Tell her my body is broken
and I can no longer breathe.

442
01:03:19,392 --> 01:03:20,267
Alright?

443
01:03:24,308 --> 01:03:27,933
And tell her that Cyrille
named his daughter after her.

444
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:30,892
Did you see Alice?

445
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:35,392
She looks like our Alice
at the same age.

446
01:03:40,433 --> 01:03:42,475
That same determined look.

447
01:03:43,767 --> 01:03:45,267
That's from your side.

448
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:50,517
Have you noticed...

449
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,683
the grotto has collapsed
since you stopped working?

450
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,850
Alice loved hiding in it so much.

451
01:04:18,308 --> 01:04:19,975
I'm going to get some wood.

452
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,475
I must finish it.

453
01:07:11,642 --> 01:07:12,892
You are...

454
01:08:49,517 --> 01:08:50,807
Impressive.

455
01:08:51,682 --> 01:08:54,807
Where did you learn
those architectural techniques?

456
01:08:56,475 --> 01:08:59,350
Excuse-me. Let me
introduce myself, Joseph Cadier.

457
01:09:00,182 --> 01:09:03,057
I've just returned to the region
after a little trip.

458
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:06,267
Where were you?

459
01:09:07,682 --> 01:09:10,557
In New York for a while,
then Boston,

460
01:09:10,975 --> 01:09:12,725
Sweden, Russia...

461
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:14,892
I've been away for 25 years.

462
01:09:17,892 --> 01:09:19,432
I've heard about you.

463
01:09:20,517 --> 01:09:24,432
Me too. As soon as I arrived,
my curiosity brought me straight here.

464
01:09:24,975 --> 01:09:27,642
Everyone speaks about your work.

465
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,767
How do you get such curved shapes
to hold at that height?

466
01:09:38,267 --> 01:09:40,808
I used a metal framework.

467
01:09:42,017 --> 01:09:44,142
Who gave you that idea?

468
01:09:45,183 --> 01:09:46,808
I gave it some thought.

469
01:09:54,267 --> 01:09:57,225
We will live
at my grandfather's house.

470
01:09:57,267 --> 01:09:59,975
Hauterives needs a good tailor.

471
01:10:00,017 --> 01:10:01,100
That's true.

472
01:10:03,683 --> 01:10:05,642
Do you think it will make him happy?

473
01:10:11,017 --> 01:10:13,267
Dreyfus is a puppet.

474
01:10:14,517 --> 01:10:17,725
An anonymous letter,
it's a bit feeble, isn't it?

475
01:10:18,558 --> 01:10:23,017
But the wretch is reserved,
taciturn, unpopular.

476
01:10:23,975 --> 01:10:25,183
An ideal culprit.

477
01:10:26,475 --> 01:10:27,767
I know the type.

478
01:10:31,392 --> 01:10:32,475
Joseph!

479
01:10:35,267 --> 01:10:39,100
Cyrille and his family
are coming to live in Hauterives and...

480
01:10:39,142 --> 01:10:42,558
he's opening a workshop.
Isn't that good news?

481
01:10:48,267 --> 01:10:51,100
I finished my training,
and I thought that you'd...

482
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,267
That people always need
a good tailor.

483
01:11:03,017 --> 01:11:06,725
Oh yes! Elegance,
that's a real art, too.

484
01:11:13,308 --> 01:11:14,350
Perhaps.

485
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:21,183
Well done for your training.

486
01:11:36,892 --> 01:11:38,558
It's basalt.

487
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,225
The statues stand
up to 3 meters high.

488
01:11:41,975 --> 01:11:43,517
They are called "Moai".

489
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:45,350
Easter Island.

490
01:11:46,225 --> 01:11:48,183
On the East facade.

491
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:50,558
They would guard the entrance. No?

492
01:11:53,183 --> 01:11:54,558
I'll think about it.

493
01:11:56,225 --> 01:11:58,850
I'll be off.
I've another 28 km to go.

494
01:11:58,892 --> 01:12:01,517
- I have 3,000 km.
- What?

495
01:12:01,558 --> 01:12:02,933
I'm going travelling again.

496
01:12:32,225 --> 01:12:33,767
I'm not alone.

497
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:37,308
Alice, look.

498
01:12:38,392 --> 01:12:39,600
Not alone.

499
01:12:40,267 --> 01:12:41,433
Alice!

500
01:12:42,725 --> 01:12:43,933
Look!

501
01:12:53,433 --> 01:12:55,392
Have you seen
how well it's progressing?

502
01:12:57,183 --> 01:12:59,058
I've built three new vaults.

503
01:13:00,433 --> 01:13:05,225
The fairies from the east
will befriend those of the west.

504
01:13:06,933 --> 01:13:09,975
Princess Daoud
whispered that in my ear,

505
01:13:10,017 --> 01:13:11,475
while I was sleeping.

506
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:16,350
Do you like it, Alice?

507
01:13:18,392 --> 01:13:19,600
Alice...

508
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:28,433
There, Cadier.

509
01:13:29,767 --> 01:13:30,892
Do you like it?

510
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:26,267
<i>To achieve your goal
you must be stubborn</i>

511
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:36,058
Can I help you?

512
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:40,517
Have you been waiting for long?

513
01:14:44,933 --> 01:14:46,308
A while.

514
01:14:48,642 --> 01:14:49,850
Pass me the trowel.

515
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,142
The small one.

516
01:14:59,517 --> 01:15:00,558
This one?

517
01:15:01,517 --> 01:15:02,725
No, both of them.

518
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:09,475
It's called a "cat's tongue".

519
01:15:23,058 --> 01:15:24,392
You can come and help me.

520
01:15:25,767 --> 01:15:27,225
But don't come to bother me.

521
01:17:28,767 --> 01:17:30,017
"It was around 10 pm,

522
01:17:30,058 --> 01:17:32,975
"when, alerted by the cries
of Marguerite Steinheil,

523
01:17:33,017 --> 01:17:37,183
"the chief of staff found the
President of the Republic, Félix Faure,

524
01:17:37,225 --> 01:17:40,683
"exceptionally virile,
agonizing on the couch,

525
01:17:40,725 --> 01:17:42,933
"dressed in a simple
flannel vest.

526
01:17:42,975 --> 01:17:45,558
"Next to him,
his mistress, in tears,

527
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,100
"was hurriedly getting dressed."

528
01:17:47,683 --> 01:17:49,850
Rich men's mistresses

529
01:17:49,892 --> 01:17:51,892
always cry in the end.

530
01:18:03,058 --> 01:18:04,433
Joseph...

531
01:18:19,017 --> 01:18:20,308
Hello, young man.

532
01:18:21,392 --> 01:18:24,350
Why do I find him
too sharply dressed?

533
01:18:29,308 --> 01:18:30,142
Hello, father.

534
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:36,517
Let me introduce
my friend, Louis Charvat.

535
01:18:37,683 --> 01:18:38,517
Louis, my father

536
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,475
and his wife, Philomène.

537
01:18:42,933 --> 01:18:44,225
And that's Garance.

538
01:18:47,433 --> 01:18:49,350
Louis wants to photograph your palace

539
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:52,558
and to make illustrated
postcards of the photos.

540
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,808
Postcards?

541
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:57,017
Explain it to us.

542
01:18:57,058 --> 01:18:59,392
My camera obscura
can take 5 photographs per day.

543
01:19:00,267 --> 01:19:04,683
With the help of a printer,
we could make 100 postcards.

544
01:19:07,558 --> 01:19:09,308
If we sell them for 5 centimes,

545
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:12,100
we could quickly make
up to 100 francs.

546
01:19:13,058 --> 01:19:14,767
That's a tidy sum.

547
01:19:22,058 --> 01:19:24,808
And your palace could be seen
all over the world.

548
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:34,225
So, what do you say?

549
01:19:38,933 --> 01:19:40,225
Are there any onions left?

550
01:19:48,725 --> 01:19:49,975
He's happy.

551
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:05,183
It lacks life.

552
01:20:12,892 --> 01:20:14,100
My palace lacks life?

553
01:20:15,267 --> 01:20:17,225
No, I mean...

554
01:20:17,267 --> 01:20:19,350
it might be better
with a figure in front.

555
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:21,850
On the staircase or the terraces.

556
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,058
Go on.

557
01:20:28,892 --> 01:20:30,308
Go on.

558
01:20:30,350 --> 01:20:31,392
Never.

559
01:20:32,975 --> 01:20:34,100
Cyrille,

560
01:20:35,183 --> 01:20:36,475
you go.

561
01:20:37,475 --> 01:20:38,600
Go on, Cyrille.

562
01:21:07,308 --> 01:21:09,225
Yes, that's much better.

563
01:21:12,392 --> 01:21:13,475
And one...

564
01:21:21,308 --> 01:21:22,350
And two...

565
01:21:22,392 --> 01:21:24,683
You annoy me, you old grouch.

566
01:21:24,725 --> 01:21:26,100
Go on, you're dying to.

567
01:21:30,392 --> 01:21:31,267
And three...

568
01:21:42,558 --> 01:21:43,892
Don't move.

569
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:50,308
Ready...

570
01:21:51,558 --> 01:21:52,433
Perfect.

571
01:22:29,225 --> 01:22:30,308
Alice.

572
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:35,475
Alice!

573
01:22:36,683 --> 01:22:38,100
Where is Alice?

574
01:22:47,725 --> 01:22:48,558
Where is your daughter?

575
01:22:49,517 --> 01:22:50,642
Girls?

576
01:22:54,767 --> 01:22:56,808
Your palace is amazing,
grandfather.

577
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:59,475
When I meet my prince charming,
I'll marry him here.

578
01:23:00,183 --> 01:23:01,725
That's nice, darling. Come.

579
01:23:26,350 --> 01:23:30,683
<i>The Story of the Ideal Palace.</i>

580
01:24:11,475 --> 01:24:12,808
It's...

581
01:24:13,392 --> 01:24:14,933
It's your son.

582
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:21,642
I didn't have time to tell him.

583
01:25:25,058 --> 01:25:26,642
He waited for so long.

584
01:25:40,017 --> 01:25:41,100
Joseph.

585
01:25:44,558 --> 01:25:46,683
Have you nearly finished your palace?

586
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:47,808
Not yet.

587
01:25:48,517 --> 01:25:50,558
I'll know when I've reached the end.

588
01:25:53,225 --> 01:25:54,767
I'm not there yet.

589
01:25:59,225 --> 01:26:01,808
The man over there
wants to offer you a drink.

590
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:03,933
He's come from Nice,
just to see your palace.

591
01:26:13,267 --> 01:26:14,850
How old are you, now?

592
01:26:15,683 --> 01:26:16,808
44 years old, Mr. Cheval.

593
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:21,642
I see.

594
01:26:30,683 --> 01:26:31,725
A glass of water.

595
01:26:34,267 --> 01:26:35,683
I'm thirsty.

596
01:26:52,767 --> 01:26:53,808
Nice.

597
01:26:54,517 --> 01:26:55,767
What?

598
01:26:57,267 --> 01:26:58,308
Nothing.

599
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:02,392
The other day,

600
01:27:03,683 --> 01:27:07,267
a gentleman came from Milan.

601
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:12,225
And I received a letter

602
01:27:13,517 --> 01:27:14,850
from an American.

603
01:27:32,267 --> 01:27:33,892
- Enjoy your visit.
- Thank you.

604
01:27:53,350 --> 01:27:55,100
<i>War has been declared!</i>

605
01:27:56,850 --> 01:27:59,058
<i>The Germans
are invading Lorraine!</i>

606
01:28:02,475 --> 01:28:04,100
<i>War has been declared!</i>

607
01:28:04,892 --> 01:28:07,017
<i>The Germans
are invading Lorraine!</i>

608
01:28:40,683 --> 01:28:42,683
Do you think I'm going to die?

609
01:28:45,975 --> 01:28:47,058
Yes.

610
01:28:48,892 --> 01:28:49,892
I think so.

611
01:28:56,517 --> 01:28:57,683
I think so.

612
01:29:08,725 --> 01:29:10,808
You made me happy.

613
01:29:21,058 --> 01:29:23,308
I wasn't made for this world.

614
01:29:31,433 --> 01:29:33,267
I wouldn't have survived it
without you.

615
01:29:34,392 --> 01:29:35,725
You found me.

616
01:29:35,767 --> 01:29:38,975
You gave me confidence.

617
01:29:40,142 --> 01:29:42,475
You gave me Alice.

618
01:29:47,392 --> 01:29:50,475
You even picked me up
when I wanted to die.

619
01:29:57,225 --> 01:30:00,225
This palace, Philomène,

620
01:30:00,933 --> 01:30:02,350
is also yours.

621
01:30:10,183 --> 01:30:11,392
Philomène...

622
01:30:41,017 --> 01:30:42,933
<i>What do you think about
as you walk?</i>

623
01:30:43,850 --> 01:30:45,600
<i>See you tomorrow, Postman Cheval.</i>

624
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:49,600
<i>These are your granddaughters.</i>

625
01:30:49,642 --> 01:30:50,933
<i>Eugénie,</i>

626
01:30:50,975 --> 01:30:54,017
<i>and... little Alice.</i>

627
01:30:54,850 --> 01:30:57,850
<i>Mom, if you see an elephant,
make it go away!</i>

628
01:30:58,642 --> 01:31:01,558
<i>Dad. Hey, Dad.</i>

629
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,892
<i>Tell her that I love her a bit more
every day, won't you?</i>

630
01:31:09,642 --> 01:31:10,808
<i>You'll tell her?</i>

631
01:31:12,183 --> 01:31:15,517
<i>I'm very happy
with the palace you're building me.</i>

632
01:31:17,058 --> 01:31:19,058
<i>It's the best palace in the world.</i>

633
01:33:34,308 --> 01:33:37,267
- What on earth is he doing?
- He's lost his mind again.

634
01:33:37,308 --> 01:33:40,267
Apparently he is building
a tomb for his daughter.

635
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:01,183
Grandfather?

636
01:34:29,975 --> 01:34:31,183
My granddaughter.

637
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:34,850
Grandfather, this is Eugène.

638
01:34:42,058 --> 01:34:45,600
Sir, I'm very honored to meet you.

639
01:34:53,767 --> 01:34:55,392
We are going to get married.

640
01:34:57,142 --> 01:34:58,350
Will you come to the wedding?

641
01:34:59,850 --> 01:35:01,642
With your prince charming.

642
01:35:04,642 --> 01:35:05,725
Will you come?

643
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:08,433
What time will it be?

644
01:35:26,725 --> 01:35:31,808
<i>33 years, 9 thousand days,
65 thousand hours for my Palace.</i>

645
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:36,808
<i>8 years for the tomb.
Work completed, September 22, 1923.</i>

646
01:36:10,392 --> 01:36:11,892
Hello, Félicienne.

647
01:36:15,850 --> 01:36:18,058
Have you finished, Cheval?

648
01:36:25,725 --> 01:36:28,558
What will you do now, Cheval?

649
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:31,975
Join them.

650
01:36:58,350 --> 01:37:01,433
Here, Cheval, a flower for you.

651
01:37:51,142 --> 01:37:53,017
Look what I found
when I cleared the house.

652
01:37:58,725 --> 01:37:59,975
It was father's.

653
01:38:01,142 --> 01:38:02,225
Your son.

654
01:39:50,475 --> 01:39:53,308
Dad, Dad, come and dance.

655
01:40:02,975 --> 01:40:04,183
I'm coming.

656
01:40:34,017 --> 01:40:37,183
<i>Joseph Ferdinand Cheval
died in 1924, at the age of 88.</i>

657
01:40:37,225 --> 01:40:41,433
<i>He devoted 33 years of his life
to building the "Ideal Palace",</i>

658
01:40:41,475 --> 01:40:43,933
<i>which represents
93,000 hours of work.</i>

659
01:40:45,392 --> 01:40:48,517
<i>On November 9,1968,
André Malraux, Minister of Culture,</i>

660
01:40:48,558 --> 01:40:51,725
<i>declared Postman Cheval's
Ideal Palace an historic monument,</i>

661
01:40:51,767 --> 01:40:55,642
<i>"we are lucky to have the only
naive architecture in the world."</i>

662
01:41:37,517 --> 01:41:40,683
<i>For Ondine</i>
