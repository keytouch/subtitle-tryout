1
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,320
Mrs. Millaud?

2
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,200
Can it be done later next time?
I am not fit in the morning because of the valium.

3
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,120
We will discuss that later.

4
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,960
Dr. Zimman
understood. We always agreed after lunch.

5
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,680
I understood.

6
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,000
What a bad luck that Dr. Zimman
had a stroke right now.

7
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,515
Do we have to start all over again?
It is as if I am repeating myself.

8
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,760
No, we are not going to repeat.
We discuss things from a different point of view.

9
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,920
This change can be very useful.

10
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,120
You look as if you want to ask
questions about my position. Or not?

11
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,680
About how I work.

12
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,800
Your name
is Catherine Bormans, you are a doctor...

13
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,760
you specialize
in psychiatry and you are a psychotherapist.

14
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,275
You have
worked in different hospitals for 20 years...

15
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,000
and you could
replace Dr. Zimman in this clinic in the short term.

16
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,600
I could find that on Google.

17
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,560
I had imagined you differently.

18
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,280
Younger.

19
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,440
You know the most important thing.

20
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,040
What should I start with?

21
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,160
What do you want to start with?

22
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,960
Ludo.

23
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,880
It is best to tell about Ludo.

24
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,560
A new project?
- Yes.

25
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,400
A bar on the beach.

26
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,120
Beautiful pictures.

27
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,200
Alex made them.
- Alex?

28
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,173
He is staying with me. A
photographer. - You didn't want people over there, did you?

29
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,280
This is different.
I already know him... We've been playing together.

30
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,800
He just got dumped.

31
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,240
It is beautiful.
You have a nice look. - Do you think?

32
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,880
I have to go. I ordered an Uber.
- Do you have to leave now?

33
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,400
The bar owner wants to see me tomorrow.
- We would spend the weekend together.

34
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,320
Are you sulking now?

35
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,680
Are you not too old for that?

36
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,760
You were just not sulking.

37
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,800
I don't understand why you do this.

38
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,320
What?
- Why are you calling me...

39
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,760
if you don't feel
like being with me?

40
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,680
I love to enjoy with you.

41
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,760
Did
you want to introduce me to your sons?

42
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,280
I could have been their brother.

43
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,440
- If you'd rather
not see me again... - I don't mean that at all.

44
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,160
You say it.

45
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,480
Can you drop me there, please?

46
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,800
We call, huh?

47
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,840
What happened to
Laclos after the scandal of risky relationships.

48
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,880
This
writer is primarily a man of action.

49
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,400
A soldier,
an engineer and a man of conviction.

50
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,920
The French
Revolution is the chance for him to write history.

51
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,835
As a follower of
the Duke of Orleans, he is suddenly arrested in...

52
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,600
He was arrested in...

53
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,448
He was arrested in...

54
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,360
In 1793?

55
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,840
In 1793. Thank you.

56
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,920
He goes first to the Force
prison and later to Picpus.

57
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,360
Who do you think
is locked up between the same walls a year later?

58
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,480
Hey?

59
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,000
Hey.  Who am I talking to?

60
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,640
Ludo's friend.
Who are you?

61
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,040
Can you... Can you give him a minute?

62
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,160
No, he's opening
oysters. - I'm Claire.

63
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,200
Claire.
Claire who? Ludo?

64
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,320
Do you know a Claire?
-No, I don't know Claire.

65
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,160
Sorry?
- I think you are mistaken.

66
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,760
Can you give him a minute?

67
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,280
I'm Alex, Ludo's assistant.
He will call you back as soon as possible.

68
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,480
OK?  good, but can I speak to Ludo?

69
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,200
He is not here.

70
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,880
I just heard him.
-He just left home.

71
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,040
Listen, this is not funny.

72
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,280
Ludo has not accepted your invitation.

73
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,880
Are you on social media, Dr. Bormans?

74
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,120
For people like me it's both...

75
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,440
a shipwreck like a raft.

76
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,400
You float in the digital world.

77
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,160
Sometimes you are the spider, sometimes it...

78
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,000
fly.

79
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,720
Register

80
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,360
Clara...

81
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,720
Clara Antun 鑣.

82
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,280
Date of birth

83
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,840
24, 25...

84
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,720
I didn't have Alex in mind.
I didn't know him, he didn't tell me anything.

85
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,128
I approached
him on Facebook to get closer to Ludo.

86
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,653
Friendship request sent

87
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,320
I didn't have to wait long.

88
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,880
Like

89
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,560
Nice that you like my photos.

90
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,400
They are fantastic.

91
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,000
Wow.  Thanks.

92
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,840
You have a lot of talent.
Good evening.

93
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,000
Wait! Which do you like best?

94
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,840
All of them.  I can not choose.

95
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,760
What kind of work do you do?

96
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,960
I'm in fashion.

97
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,240
Fashion model?

98
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,000
Don't get carried away.

99
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,240
I organize fashion events

100
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,080
As an intern.
They pay a lot of money.

101
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,830
I don't know that expression.

102
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,680
My boss is a huge miser.

103
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,160
... stingy man.

104
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,520
My boss is a loser...

105
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,080
but it looks good on my resume.

106
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,400
I have time.  I'm still young.

107
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,840
How was it?

108
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,720
Was okay.

109
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,480
Have you done anything special?

110
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,240
Bowed.

111
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,720
Well, isn't that
nice? - Yes.

112
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,600
Was she there too?

113
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,320
It doesn't bother me anymore.

114
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,640
Of course.
- Really.

115
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,515
Why do you ask?
It is just like Siamese twins.

116
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,440
They are so stupid.

117
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,520
Who won?

118
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,800
She the first time and dad after
that, I believe.

119
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,720
Not you?

120
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,560
He was the last one, the loser.
- Shut up.

121
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,520
We can speak French
here, that's okay.

122
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,560
Max, not at the table.

123
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,235
'Child, do not envy us
for our age, in which the heart is slave and rebellious

124
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,515
In which
laughter is more sad than your tears

125
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,915
Do not rush
your thoughts. Enjoy the morning, the spring

126
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,540
Your days are like entangled flowers
Don't pick the leaves early '

127
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,835
Not really inspiring.
Sorry, this is for old people.

128
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,240
Well, you
understood the theme, that is already something.

129
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,520
And what am I doing now?

130
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,080
I don't have to take a final exam this year.

131
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,880
Still in a meeting

132
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,360
Which style figures does he use?

133
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,600
What is the rhyme scheme?

134
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,720
Pretty nice.

135
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,875
I want to help,
but I also think about it.

136
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,600
OK?  also fine.

137
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,800
Don't get mad.

138
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,080
It is crossed rhyme, ABAB.

139
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,800
There are three style figures.

140
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,200
Have you ever heard of metaphors?

141
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,920
That little green light...

142
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,158
that indicates
that the other is also online, just like you...

143
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,640
for his screen.

144
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,440
What did you feel when you saw that green light?

145
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,360
Consolation.

146
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,640
A pinch of Ventolin and
I could breathe better.

147
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,880
I am...

148
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,520
very ugly...

149
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,800
and very old.

150
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,480
The excitement.

151
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,280
And also funny.

152
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,800
Maybe he watches what you do...

153
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,915
the photos
you comment on, the music you listen to...

154
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,840
Really
crazy what they all know about you.

155
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,600
Are you not at Insta?

156
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,440
Insta?

157
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,000
Social network,
share photos and videos, mobile platforms...

158
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,080
It is not
my style to do what everyone else does.

159
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,920
You can buy tickets via the internet.

160
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,880
It's gonna be hard for you.  Why?

161
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,555
You can't live without me anymore.

162
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,760
Only with a priority pass you
have no queue. - It's faster.

163
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,280
Claire, are you okay?  Is something wrong?

164
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,600
No, or actually.

165
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,720
A rude guy.

166
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,040
Tell.  Who is it?

167
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,400
Nothing,
just a boy who gets carried away.

168
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,560
A student?
- He likes to play with fire. No.

169
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,040
Perhaps. - You're not going
to play the cougar, are you?

170
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,960
I do not play.

171
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,760
It is serious.

172
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,360
Do we call women cougars and men?

173
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,480
That's a man, right?

174
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,275
Men with younger women have always
been there. They just think so.

175
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,040
It is not the same either.
It is on a different level.

176
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,280
The devils' advocate.

177
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,000
I want to know exactly what you want.

178
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,320
You intrigue me.

179
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,240
Really?  Woezo

180
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,760
How you do.

181
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,240
How do I do ???

182
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,160
Intriguing.

183
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,755
If we had to choose
an independent female writer from the 20th century...

184
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,000
we would end up at Marguerite Duras.

185
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,720
"Very quickly," she wrote...

186
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,920
'it was too late in my life.
It was already too late at the age of 18.

187
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,480
Between the
ages of 18 and 25, my face went unforeseen.

188
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,955
I
never asked if everyone has that...

189
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,280
but I did hear about the
advance of the time when you sometimes get caught...

190
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,280
while you are in
your younger years, the most celebrated years. "

191
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,320
Every word was chosen with care.

192
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,560
A small mistake on my part...

193
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,440
a wrong word choice and...

194
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,120
the magic could go up in smoke.

195
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,200
Do you know what I would like?

196
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,400
Tell me!

197
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,640
A REAL PHOTO OF YOU

198
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,040
I could not refuse him that photo.

199
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,600
Why not?

200
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,080
Then he would suspect something.

201
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,440
I could not go back.

202
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,680
It excited me, I think.

203
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,640
It was at that time...

204
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,165
that I ended up in a spiral.

205
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,800
A spiral?

206
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,600
I
would give Clara Antun a real face.

207
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,200
Hey?

208
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,400
With Clara.

209
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,880
Do you have a restricted number?

210
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,680
I want to be sure you don't...

211
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,880
are a psychopath.

212
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,000
I understand.

213
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,560
And...

214
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,800
don't I sound like Dexter?
- No.

215
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,640
Your voice sounds...

216
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,230
Strange,
but I had imagined it differently.

217
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,440
Well, I...

218
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,080
Sorry.

219
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,080
That is not necessary.  You...

220
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,680
You have a nice voice.

221
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,080
Honestly I find my own voice...

222
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,520
terribly annoying.

223
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,880
No, it is not.

224
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,240
That is nice of you.

225
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Your voice sounds...

226
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,520
very young.

227
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,800
How old are you exactly?

228
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,960
You are an adult, aren't you?

229
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,560
24, right?

230
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,280
Almost 25.

231
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,200
You sound younger.
- I often hear that.

232
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,080
I posted a photo.

233
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,200
Don't you like it?

234
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,720
Yes.  He's fantastic.

235
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,920
So you like me?

236
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,000
Yes, you can say that.

237
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,555
Have you seen my comment?

238
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,960
How
can I not like this beautiful creature?

239
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,480
Thank you.

240
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,960
Well...

241
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,400
Can I have your telephone number now?

242
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,440
OK?

243
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,360
Not only shielded,
now you also fall silent.

244
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,880
Clara.

245
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,160
Whose photo was it?

246
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,560
No idea.  I chose it by accident.

247
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:17,560
You didn't mind
that if Alex introduced you, he wouldn't see you...

248
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,440
but someone else?

249
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,400
No not really.

250
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,240
He said he liked my voice.

251
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,040
My words,
my way of thinking, and I really am.

252
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,160
If I had told the
truth and posted a real photo on Facebook...

253
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,883
he had not accepted me as a friend.

254
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,593
At least he
didn't want to make contact with a woman like me.

255
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,720
"A woman like me?"

256
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,960
Yes, a woman...

257
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,840
with
heavy eyelids and a pale complexion.

258
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,440
You want
people to find you beautiful and young.

259
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,000
Yet?

260
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,320
I never wanted to give up that pleasure.

261
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,730
I like it when people look
at me and like me. You not?

262
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,155
And yet it is precisely this man...

263
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,280
sent a picture of another woman.

264
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,740
Yes, I did the opposite.

265
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,200
As if...

266
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,480
I didn't give myself the
chance to exist in his eyes.

267
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,115
Now you can
call me whenever you want, Clara de Stomme.

268
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,395
In his analysis, Baudelaire
Marquise sees the Merteuil as a female Tartuffe...

269
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,645
always one step ahead and
superior to Valmont.

270
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,040
What interested him most was not
her superiority to Valmont...

271
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,240
but her
rebellion as a woman, her rebellion...

272
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,480
against a hypocritical society.

273
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,200
Open your book and go to letter 81.

274
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,080
9 missed calls

275
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,760
When
I was with him, I felt a vibrant life.

276
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,560
Merteuil
decided early on to create a unique ego.

277
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,280
I had never felt so full of life.

278
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,880
I didn't pretend to be 24...

279
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,280
i was 24

280
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,280
Have you known many men?

281
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,920
On Facebook?

282
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,560
No, I mean...

283
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,680
men who have meant something to you.
- A man really meant something to me.

284
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,840
You
are not yet 25. You have enough time.

285
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,760
Do you still think about him?

286
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,800
Preferably...

287
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,440
I only
remembered the beautiful moments, but...

288
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,600
that is difficult.

289
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,840
What did you talk about?

290
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,280
About theater, art...

291
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,440
literature.

292
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,120
OK?  so you went with an intellectual?

293
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,400
Yes.
Was he older than you?

294
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,080
A little.

295
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,785
You'll be bored to death
with a man like me.

296
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,200
Do I make that impression?

297
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,880
Not really.

298
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,000
It's a long time ago...

299
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,720
that I felt so
comfortable with someone.

300
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,440
That reassures me.

301
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,600
Clara?
- Yes?

302
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,360
I believe something is happening.

303
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,560
That doesn't happen...

304
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,080
in one day.

305
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,240
Sometimes.

306
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,480
This is the proof.

307
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,360
Hey. Everything good?
- Yes. Your hair looks nice.

308
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,880
Thank you. - You look good.

309
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,160
You too, by the way.
- I watch my condition.

310
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:14,840
10 and 11 in Caluire, 12 in
Lausanne... - Gilles, I don't care about your theater tour.

311
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,920
I'll explain. I'll catch up
with the weeks. - We are not going to change the schedule.

312
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,200
Solve it with your girlfriend.
She doesn't have a bag to do.

313
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,860
No bag?  And a French teacher says that.

314
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,915
Can she take care of them now?
- I've changed my mind.

315
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:35,720
So nice to be selfish.
It took me over 20 years with you to realize that.

316
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,280
Don't ask me why.

317
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,400
You met someone.

318
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,475
You would like to know, don't you?
- I just want to know how you are doing.

319
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,840
I met someone if you want
to know. He is handsome...

320
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,400
He's tender.

321
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,200
And with him everything is...

322
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,880
relax.
- Congratulations.

323
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,520
I'm starting to break free from you.
That is really cool.

324
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,960
How was the party?

325
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,280
It was awful. -Really? How so?

326
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,128
The average age was 55.
Incredible.

327
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,840
You are kidding me. - What a hell.

328
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,400
Unbelieveable.

329
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,200
They were trying to decorate you.

330
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,200
Perhaps.

331
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,520
Are you home yet?
- I'm even in bed already.

332
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,880
What are you wearing?

333
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,040
A low-cut sweater...

334
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,600
shorts...

335
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,440
Are you naked under your sweater?

336
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,200
Yes.

337
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,080
Take it off.

338
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,200
I put my hand on your
stomach. Do you feel it?

339
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,400
Yes, I feel it.

340
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,280
I slide it up very slowly...

341
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,320
to your chest.

342
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,760
Yes.
- You have such beautiful breasts.

343
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,280
Round and sturdy.

344
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,720
I want to kiss
them. - Kiss them.

345
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,480
I kiss your nipples.

346
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,640
Do you feel how I suck on your nipples?

347
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,400
Do you know
what I want while I suck on your nipples?

348
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,400
That you put your hand in your pants.

349
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,080
I want that too.

350
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,600
You want that, right?
- Yes.

351
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,760
Say it.

352
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,840
I want...

353
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,240
slide a finger
into my underpants.

354
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,960
Do it then.

355
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,320
How does it feel?

356
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,000
Warm.
-Hot and wet?

357
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,720
Very warm and very wet.

358
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,080
Do you feel your pussy?

359
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,400
Go ahead, do it.

360
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,800
As horny as you finger
yourself. Continue.

361
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,920
I want to hear you moan.

362
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,480
I get a stiff from you.

363
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,240
I'm going in you.

364
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,880
Come on.

365
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,720
Come.

366
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,560
How nice.

367
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,040
It's so...

368
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,000
Alex.

369
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,840
Oh, dear.

370
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,480
Dear.

371
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,520
I miss making love.

372
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,080
Not just the...

373
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,320
But the kisses, the caresses...

374
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,600
touching each other...

375
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,948
or actually being touched.

376
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,720
What is love without desire?

377
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,800
Tell me about yourself.
I tell you everything and you...

378
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,880
You say nothing.

379
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,160
I am only the temporary
confidant of a message that is not intended for me.

380
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,760
So you are not flexible at
all? - No, I am a doctor.

381
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,600
Your doctor.

382
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,760
No girlfriend.

383
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,000
Have you never been
to bed with a client?

384
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,880
That often happens...

385
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,000
that
someone longs for his therapist, right?

386
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,400
Seems to be the...

387
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,680
that it is sometimes part of the process.

388
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,920
The process.

389
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,480
The healing process.

390
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,960
Yes,
for the patient, but what about the doctor?

391
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,800
We learn
something from ourselves with every patient.

392
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,840
Sometimes it delivers...

393
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,063
theoretical knowledge and sometimes...

394
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,080
something personal.

395
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,160
Did it excite you?

396
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,880
That scene in
the car with Alex on the phone, excitement, huh?

397
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:02,800
There are limits,
Claire, set by the medical code of conduct.

398
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,040
So we can't see each
other? - Not next week.

399
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,075
I have to look after my
niece. - You promised.

400
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,640
I really have little
time. Sorry...

401
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,840
We cannot continue like this.
I want to see you.

402
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,560
It's complicated.  Now understand me.

403
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,760
I'm really doing my best, but .
.. At least tell me you don't think about anything else.

404
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,920
What is she doing?

405
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,240
Will she have forgotten us?

406
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,040
I'm madly in love with you, Alex.
Really. I feel so comfortable with you.

407
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,360
I would also like
to see you, feel you... That everything else fails.

408
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,040
I'm in the car now.
I'll call you back. Good?

409
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,120
It was your father.

410
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,920
Go for it.

411
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,840
Violation.

412
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,040
That is a violation.

413
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,000
What a ref.
Buy goddamn glasses.

414
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,680
Mom, sit down.
- He looked dirty at me, but it is true.

415
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,800
Do you have children, doctor?

416
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You must have a brilliant man.

417
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,560
Or not.

418
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,320
Isn't it frustrating to never
be able to give your opinion?

419
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,120
If you knew
what went through my mind, sometimes...

420
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,480
would you fall out of your seat.

421
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,880
We were talking about children.

422
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,120
Yes, my sons.

423
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,240
My sons.

424
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,400
When they were with their father...

425
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,920
I found it difficult.
- How difficult?

426
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,040
Then I let myself go.

427
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,960
How far?

428
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,240
So far...

429
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,520
that I felt more like Clara than Claire.

430
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,640
You
think I'm just like any other girl.

431
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,840
Clara...

432
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,720
But you do not know me.

433
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,160
I know you are unique.

434
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,400
Yes.

435
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,940
We must not go too fast.

436
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,440
Even though it's hard for both of us.

437
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,200
It makes me crazy.

438
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,360
OK?  a gift for mister Ongeduld.

439
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,595
You still
haven't said where that photo came from...

440
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,360
or that video.

441
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,230
Yes, just look in your notes.
I happened to find them on Google.

442
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,480
Accidentally. Really.

443
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,800
Why should I lie?

444
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,560
It's the face he fell on.
The photo of that young woman.

445
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,360
It is not...

446
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,360
nothing or unimportant.

447
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,280
It was a stranger.

448
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,840
Yes.

449
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,395
Did you get the photos and
videos of a stranger so easily?

450
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,840
What world do you live
in? Of course it's easy.

451
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,640
Everyone is displaying their lives.
It is there for the taking.

452
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,280
Claire, this is no questioning
and if you don't tell the truth, I can't help you.

453
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,998
Well, what difference does it make?

454
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,640
You will enjoy it.

455
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,160
It was a photo of my niece Katia.

456
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,600
Satisfied?
You get along with that, huh?

457
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,160
Your niece?

458
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,288
A beautiful blonde.
Alex seemed to fall blond. No more.

459
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,600
No more? - Yes, no more.

460
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,080
Tell me about that niece.

461
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,080
Good, but there is little to say.

462
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,200
Katia is my brother's daughter.

463
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,080
After he was killed with his wife...

464
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,800
she suddenly became
orphan. That's all.

465
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:28,040
I do not understand what you mean.
- I brought my niece into the house.

466
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:33,388
I took care of her
like a daughter, while I barely knew her before.

467
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,680
Does she know...

468
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,240
of that photo?

469
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,920
No, we don't see each other anymore.

470
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,960
As soon as the
legacy was settled, Katia left for Norway.

471
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:57,120
So you have
accepted her face, her age and her story.

472
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,760
What did you want?

473
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,440
Another life?

474
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,000
Not another life, my own life.

475
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,600
Finally.

476
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,400
I didn't go outside yesterday.
It rained.

477
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,960
Here also.

478
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,040
I thought...

479
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,960
maybe she has time to call me.

480
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,360
I have to go to bed.

481
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,600
Do you want me to stay?

482
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
I fall over with fatigue.

483
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,880
Sometimes you sound like a mother.

484
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,560
Would you still love me if...

485
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,280
when i'm old?

486
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,160
How old?

487
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,040
50.

488
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,000
50?  That is still possible.

489
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,000
We still have our whole lives.

490
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,520
Did you wait for
me? -Of course.

491
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,640
Sweet. What did you do in the meantime?
Prepare my trip.

492
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,640
Which trip?

493
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,640
I'm going to Goa at the end of the month.

494
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,200
Only?

495
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:47,200
No, together with my roommate. You
know, Ludo. I told you about him.

496
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,040
How long?
-Two months.

497
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,800
Are you afraid you can't live without me?

498
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,480
Clara?

499
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,560
How long have you known this?

500
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,000
For a long time.

501
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,000
And you only tell it now.

502
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,680
You came unexpectedly, beautiful.

503
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,760
You know what?  Come along.

504
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,120
I can not. -Yes.
Just stop your internship.

505
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,718
We only live once.

506
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,920
What
will change for us when I am in Goa?

507
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,960
I think it's scary to think
you're far away. So far.

508
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,513
It's
not that we can hold each other, right?

509
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,440
Do
you miss me? Do you want to see me?

510
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,520
Of course.

511
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,880
That makes sense.  Do not you?

512
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,040
Yes, but...

513
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,760
I am so afraid...

514
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,560
I'm afraid to disappoint you.
-Of course not.

515
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,680
that I know for sure.

516
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,240
I'm also afraid to disappoint you.

517
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,480
Clara...

518
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,400
What are you doing here?

519
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,480
Are we going outside?
I need fresh air.

520
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,800
OK, come on.

521
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,720
I can not forget him.

522
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,920
What can you not forget?

523
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,120
He
has become the center of my universe.

524
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,155
During his trip to Goa we spoke to each
other every day. Several times even.

525
00:48:09,579 --> 00:48:11,355


526
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,920
If only it could stay that way.

527
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:19,280
When he
returned, he started to push more and more...

528
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,128
and it
became more difficult to stop the boat.

529
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,320
Surprise?
I landed this morning.

530
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,960
Alex will be with Clara in three minutes

531
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:30,920
I was there...

532
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,600
in the same city as you.

533
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,560
I could not.  Not today.

534
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,760
Wait, this is depressing.

535
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,280
You are a psychopath.
You are kidding me.

536
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,440
You are insane. - No me...

537
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,480
Hey?

538
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,320
What are you doing here?
- It is Sunday.

539
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:58,320
Of course, I was already waiting for you.
I was already a little worried.

540
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,000
Will be.

541
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,725
What is it?
- I'm going to set the table.

542
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,200
Who was that?  What are you doing?

543
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,800
Friends are unexpectedly passing by.

544
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:15,560
You talk softly. Do you have a party?
- I have to hang up. I'm still calling you.

545
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:20,400
No, you don't mean this. Are you
kidding me? Clara, I'm tired of it.

546
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:24,955
I always adapt to you. Can't we
call now? What is wrong with you?

547
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,040
The refrigerator is empty.
- I make pancakes.

548
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,600
There are no eggs.

549
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,320
What?

550
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,160
I have to tell you something.

551
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,080
What?

552
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,520
I have a relationship.

553
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,040
We live together.

554
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,520
A long time already?

555
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,600
A few months for you.
I don't know so well anymore.

556
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,160
Damn.  And you say so?

557
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,093
Couldn't you have said that
earlier? - I've tried it.

558
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,320
Does he know about me?

559
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,760
No.

560
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:15,720
Gilles is very jealous and paranoid. It
is not going so well between us. So...

561
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,760
Well, I...

562
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,300
I now understand why you didn't want to see me.

563
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:31,600
You kept me on the line for
weeks. - I'm sorry, Alex.

564
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,440
This really hurts.

565
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,240
Sorry.

566
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:42,000
I have to hang up.
I have to process this.

567
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,600
Sorry.

568
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,720
Hello, Clara.

569
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:14,560
I don't know
how you are doing, but I'm completely lost.

570
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,640
That I can be so captivated by you.

571
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:23,920
I can't do anything
anymore. I'm going crazy.

572
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:29,040
I'm in Paris next week.
My train arrives at Montparnasse at 3:02 pm.

573
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,720
Don't call me or send me messages.

574
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,600
If you really
care about me, make sure you get there.

575
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,240
You
don't know how much I want to meet you.

576
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:16,328
It became unbearable.
I had to make a decision, there was nothing else to it.

577
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:19,480
It broke my heart.

578
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,240
But when I saw him on the bus,
so young and vulnerable...

579
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,360
did I know that the moment had arrived...

580
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,760
It hurt me too much.

581
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:36,960
Alex,
something unexpected happened yesterday...

582
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,895
Gilles asked me to marry him.

583
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,960
I said yes.

584
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,800
We are going to emigrate to Brazil.

585
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,640
He has taken on work there.

586
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,560
I know I am making the right choice.

587
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,600
You and
I lived in a dream with our eyes open.

588
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,720
It was delicious...

589
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,560
but it was no more than a dream.

590
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,120
Don't be mad at me.

591
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,720
I
always keep a place for you in my heart.

592
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,720
I
resumed my old life as you close a novel.

593
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,720
Hurt...

594
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,280
floored...

595
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,120
old.

596
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,560
When I wanted to contact me
again, it was too late.

597
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,880
His page was gone.

598
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:48,080
By disappearing
Alex was more radical than me and in a way...

599
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,320
stronger too.

600
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,160
Hey.

601
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,920
I have been busy.  No more.

602
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,080
Indeed.

603
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,760
What an insight.

604
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:18,440
I didn't hesitate for long.
Only then could I find out how he was doing.

605
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,800
You look fantastic.
- Thank you.

606
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,240
But this year I have
worked almost continuously.

607
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:30,120
And you? Are
you okay with your construction projects?

608
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,195
Its way.
- You look tired. Are you OK?

609
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,080
Yes, yes.

610
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:39,640
It's just a little
hard now. - Difficult?

611
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,160
Do you remember my friend Alex?

612
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,120
The photographer. - Yes, vague.

613
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,400
He had a car accident.

614
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,800
He has driven off a cliff.

615
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,600
Unbelievable, right?

616
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:07,120
Only because of a
psychopath he knew from Facebook but had never met.

617
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,160
The police saw that he had not braked.

618
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,400
He is dead.

619
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,000
Sorry.

620
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:38,760
Hey?

621
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,200
If someone dies...

622
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,360
what
do we do with his virtual identity?

623
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,360
Do we leave it as it
is? Do we delete it?

624
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,920
What kind of choice do we have?

625
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,080
Wait.

626
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,520
I've written it down.

627
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,200
It was vital, necessary.

628
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:08,120
I want to hear your
opinion. It is important.

629
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,200
I'll read it.

630
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,800
REAL SECRETS by Claire Millaud

631
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,480
For a long time the idea
that nothing would happen between us was unbearable.

632
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:34,920
Stopping it was like giving up life.

633
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:38,400
In
the end I was crazy about this man.

634
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:46,520
Why should I give up?
What did it cost to try?

635
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,600
The
fear of not being able to replace Clara?

636
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,080
Would Alex be unhappy?

637
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,720
But I could comfort him.

638
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,960
Sorry, I think I know you.

639
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,840
Sorry?
- I think I know you.

640
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,640
Are you not a friend of Ludo's?
- Ludovic? Yes.

641
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:59,600
I knew it. I am his...
A friend of the past.

642
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:05,830
No light comes on?

643
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:10,760
The oysters.
On the phone. - Oh yeah.

644
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,120
Do you still live with him in Somme?

645
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:22,760
He hasn't evicted me yet.

646
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,600
Then you must have a good character.

647
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,600
Are you a photographer?

648
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,240
More or less.

649
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:40,040
I'm working on an exhibition.

650
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,280
Ludo had told me about it.

651
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:48,320
He had shown some pictures of you.

652
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,280
I found them very beautiful.

653
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:55,120
Thanks.

654
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,120
I have to get the next one out.

655
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:18,275
Do you also make portraits?
I do not mean unplaced photos on the street...

656
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,760
but portraits of...

657
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:25,800
Yes, I do too.
I make portraits, photo albums...

658
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,440
I do everything except weddings.

659
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:32,520
I need a photo for my next book.

660
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,880
They
usually send a photographer, but now...

661
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:40,040
Funny
that I bump into you, maybe you can...

662
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,440
Hell yes...

663
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:47,360
I'm looking for work
so that would be great.

664
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:51,208
Crazy. Can I have
your phonenumber? - If you are interested...

665
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,760
Sorry, I forgot your
first name. - Claire.

666
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,800
My name is Claire.

667
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:15,320
But it is
mainly about Nora in Ibsens A dollhouse.

668
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,840
The doll, the good wife...

669
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:21,400
the responsible
mother. She is.

670
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:25,795
The play is
about the awakening of her consciousness.

671
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,800
The emancipation of a woman outside
the role that society imposes on her.

672
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:37,280
More than a century later that refusal
to conform still appeals to us...

673
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,680
You do not want to
keep to the standards in which you are imprisoned.

674
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,123
How did he do that?

675
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,240
What?  Who?

676
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,360
Ludo. How could he go out with such a beautiful
woman like you? You are super photogenic.

677
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,200
Very well.
Shall we maybe...

678
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:14,200
loosen your top button?
- From my blouse?

679
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:19,640
The book is
intended for academics, I don't know if...

680
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:22,520
All
the more reason to seduce the reader.

681
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,680
Well done.

682
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,560
Awesome.

683
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:40,560
Take a seat.
- Relax a little more?

684
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,080
Sorry, I moved.
- Does not matter.

685
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:56,280
Are you married, children, divorced?
- Indeed.

686
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,480
All three hit.
- And in the right order.

687
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:07,160
And all for your 30th.
You hide something from me.

688
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,840
May I...

689
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,680
try something?

690
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:27,400
Are you okay or do you want
to take a break? -No, go on.

691
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:35,000
I have nothing to hide.

692
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:44,045
I have been married for 20 years
to a man who was everything to me.

693
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:55,480
I've had friends for him, but that
was so long ago. I forgot them.

694
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,720
I have had two
children. Two boys.

695
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:08,973
I thought I
was a good mother if I gave them a breast...

696
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:13,680
My breasts have never recovered,
neither has my belly.

697
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:22,840
My husband left me for a woman
who could be my daughter.

698
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:33,120
When
that happened, I thought I'd die of grief.

699
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:39,240
I'm too passionate.
That's the right word.

700
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:42,680
But I can also be happy.

701
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,280
So I think...

702
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,680
that you know pretty much everything.

703
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,560
Crazy.

704
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,600
What?

705
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,720
Nothing. Our meeting.
Thats crazy.

706
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:54,440
So, or you cut it into a portrait.
That is a bit sharper.

707
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:57,880
I like that.

708
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:02,560
This one is beautiful
and we have it with a smile and I like it the most.

709
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:05,120
You too? -Yes.

710
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,680
We are free day and night.

711
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,280
We had to make up for lost time.

712
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:58,560
We started living
together very quickly, or he actually moved in with me.

713
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:05,280
Extinguish my eyes, I can still see you

714
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:08,720
Close my ears, I can still hear you

715
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,680
And
without feet, I can still follow you

716
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:15,280
And even
without a mouth, I can still call you

717
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:20,280
Read on.
-No you.

718
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,200
Please. -To go on.

719
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:34,320
Break my arms and
I embrace you with my heart like with one hand

720
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:39,635
Hold my heart,
and my brain will beat, ignite my brain

721
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,000
my blood will carry you

722
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,480
I love you.

723
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:51,320
I love you so much.
- I love you too.

724
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,760
Do you know what I love the most?

725
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,640
Very crazy...

726
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,720
but that is your voice.

727
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:30,120
Claire's voice is Clara's.

728
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,440
Of course he was still thinking about her.

729
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:37,943
Was I
thinking that my face would replace hers?

730
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:09,440
How could I forget
that I was a consolation because he had lost her?

731
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:14,080
Even worse.  He loved her through me.

732
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:40,760
There is no
greater rival than the one that does not exist.

733
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,835
Alex, I couldn't forget you.
It's over with Gilles.

734
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,715
I'm back in Paris.
I love you. I've missed you.

735
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:10,675
I don't know where you are, but if you
still love me, come to Caf? Fran is.

736
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,835
I will be there between 6 pm and 8 pm.
Don't try to call me. If you don't come...

737
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:19,320
you'll never hear from me
again. I promise. Your Clara.

738
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:22,360
Are you ready? - Yes.

739
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,520
We go? -Yes.

740
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:30,640
Do you really not want to stay at home?
-No, I want to have lunch somewhere.

741
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:34,160
The point is that I'd rather eat you.

742
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,600
Shall we go to the movies?

743
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,280
Certainly.

744
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,120
Take a look at what's going on.

745
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,320
I'm going to get a sweater.

746
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,440
I'm cold.

747
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,920
Welcome back, Clara.

748
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:29,165
We hear screams, howling brakes,
a blow. And finally silence.

749
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,680
In a movie it could end like this.

750
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,520
Yes, and in reality?

751
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:06,160
Why don't you come up with a happy ending?

752
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:11,445
Even in a fantasy world, you are not
lucky, as if you want to hurt yourself...

753
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,920
time after time.

754
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:18,920
Who hurt you, Claire?

755
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,200
Who hurt you?

756
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:49,280
Do you know what I stole from Katia?

757
01:22:54,760 --> 01:23:00,040
It took me a while
to realize, but the attitude of Katia, my niece...

758
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,760
became more hostile towards me...

759
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:08,520
in the course of time.

760
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:14,720
Gilles is her uncle,
through our marriage...

761
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:19,320
I have
been told often enough, no kinship...

762
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:26,520
"She loves me, I
love her, no aggravating circumstances, only love."

763
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:28,360
His words.

764
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,080
Actually...

765
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:48,520
27 years of age difference
against 20 years of marriage.

766
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:57,960
Katia did not
return to Norway, she moved in with my husband.

767
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,560
I couldn't tell you.

768
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,840
Not even writing.

769
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:34,533
They destroyed me.
She destroyed me.

770
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:49,600
But was she your rival...

771
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,260
that you had chosen to embody you?

772
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:54,640
Yes.

773
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:01,360
I wanted her beauty,
her youth...

774
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:06,280
I envied
her for her happiness, she had stolen mine.

775
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,720
I was jealous.

776
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:20,200
It all happens as if you
refuse the truth, as if you are fleeing from a truth.

777
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:27,200
The desire for
eternity, the illusion of eternal youth, yes.

778
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:30,930
We all want to stay far away...

779
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,348
at the prospect of our death.

780
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,520
I don't mind dying...

781
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,520
but they are let down.

782
01:26:16,280 --> 01:26:18,655
We are never too old to be small.

783
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:26,960
I wanted to
be cared for, lulled, even with illusions.

784
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:20,480
How long has it been?

785
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:24,440
She was admitted
about nine months ago

786
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,840
It went pretty far.

787
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,640
Alex was completely captivated by her.

788
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:37,720
So
bad that one day he sent me a message.

789
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:42,840
I immediately recognized her voice.

790
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,640
At first I didn't want to believe it.

791
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:50,160
I thought it was a game.

792
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,520
Something perverse.

793
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,320
I didn't
say anything to Alex, but I told him...

794
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:02,600
that girl, that Clara....

795
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,600
was too perfect.

796
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,760
Then he started to doubt.

797
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:15,000
When
Clara disappeared, he deleted his profile.

798
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:21,320
A few months later she called me.

799
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:27,560
I said he was dead because of her.

800
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:32,285
That he had turned his back.

801
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:38,840
My friend went crazy and I...

802
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,560
I don't like being cheated.

803
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:47,360
So I lied.

804
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,720
I do not understand.

805
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,360
Has he not been killed?

806
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,480
No.

807
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,480
He even just became a father.

808
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,560
He lives in southern France.

809
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:34,760
He is married.

810
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,000
He became a father last month.

811
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:41,160
From a girl.

812
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,720
We think we are guilty, so not.

813
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,520
I'm coming to say goodbye.

814
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:48,005
Sometimes a
patient has something that we had and are lost.

815
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,160
I have taken your advice to heart.

816
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,200
I am working on my manuscript again.

817
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:13,360
It was good
to realize that everything is possible again.

818
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:16,680
That there is not just one end.

819
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:19,840
No.

820
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:22,080
Is right.

821
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,200
See you again, Claire.

822
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,360
Bye.
